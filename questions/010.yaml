  options:
  - The lowest altitude above the aerodrome elevation below which an aircraft cannot
    descend without infringing the appropriate obstacle clearance criteria.
  - The lowest altitude, below which an aircraft must initiate a missed approach if
    visual references cannot be established.
  - The lowest altitude at which a missed approach must be initiated to ensure compliance
    with the appropriate obstacle clearance criteria.
  - The lowest altitude or the elevation of the relevant runway threshold, if the
    threshold elevation is more than 2 m (7 ft) below the aerodrome elevation, below
    which an aircraft cannot descend without infringing the appropriate obstacle clearance
