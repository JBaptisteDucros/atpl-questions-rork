    icing conditions during the flight. Is it important for the crew to keep their
    eye reference positions aligned throughout the flight?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - No. Visual icing cues are all beyond the crew's primary field of view. A large
    head movement will always be needed for the ice detector to be seen.
  - No. The eye reference position has nothing to do with ice detection.
  - Yes, for the Commander only, as the eye reference position ensures that the pilot
    in the left-hand seat can see the ice detector probe without movement.
  - Yes. If possible, visual icing cues should be within the crew's primary field
    of view.

  - On-condition maintenance, where an aircraft item such as the landing gear is removed
    from service at or before reaching a specified time or amount of cycles.
  - Hard-time maintenance, where an item is completely removed and disassembled to
    allow for a thorough inspection of the item.
  - Hard-time maintenance, overhauling an aircraft component within the time limits
    of the maintenance programme as determined by the manufacturer.

  - manual braking can be used; however, the stopping distance is likely greater than
    with anti-skid in all surface conditions.
  - manual braking will result in a longer stopping distance on wet or contaminated

  options:
  - On most aeroplanes the auto-brake system provides a constant deceleration during

  - When using manual braking during taxiing, the auto-brake system will disarm.
  - When a low auto-brake setting is used during landing use of reverse will not influence
    the brake temperature.
  - When the auto-brake system is inoperative, in general take-off is not allowed,

  options:
  - Manual braking is the most efficient way to decelerate the aircraft.
  - Without pilot input, the RTO mode will automatically brake the aircraft to a full
    stop.
  - RTO has a fixed force with which the aircraft is decelerated.
  - With RTO not available, take-off might not be allowed because the minimum braking
    distance with manual braking is longer.

    on transport aeroplanes?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - Because full rudder deflection could create an excessive load on the structure.
  - Full rudder deflection is not to be limited on transport aeroplanes as airspeed
    increases.
  - To reduce the directional stability at high airspeed.
  - To reduce the risk of entering a spiral divergence in cruise.

  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - The flight control surfaces are connected to the flight deck controls by means
    of mechanical links only.
  - The deflection angle of the flight control surface will vary with airspeed, therefore,
    the flight control forces are constant.
  - A fully manual flight control system is an irreversible system because there is
    no flight deck flight control feedback when a flight control surface is in motion.
  - A fully manual flight control system is manually operated by the pilot by means
    of the flight control elements and is powered by a hydraulic system.

  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - It increases manoeuvrability and responsiveness, it is a simpler design and therefore
    saves on production cost, but it is harder to inspect after de-icing, and requires
    more ground handling equipment.
  - It has a smoother airflow and therefore more predictable flight characteristics,
    but requires a stronger, heavier fin, and is susceptible to loss of effectiveness
    at high angles of attack.
  - It allows for greater ground clearance when taxiing, it is a simpler design, therefore
    saving production cost, but it is harder to inspect after de-icing, and requires
    more ground handling equipment.
  - It has a smoother airflow, therefore more predictable flight characteristics,
    it has a wider operating range in pitch, but requires a stronger, therefore heavier
    fin.

    The oil pressure on one engine is low, however the oil quantity on that engine
    has increased. The most likely explanation is:'
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - One fault - A leak in the fuel/oil heat exchanger, causing high pressure fuel
    to enter the oil system. This causes an increase in oil level, but due to dilution
    with fuel, a lower oil pressure.
  - One fault - A leak in the fuel/oil heat exchanger, causing high pressure oil to
    enter the fuel system. If not corrected, the oil being burnt will cause the fuel
    nozzles to become clogged.
  - Two faults - A worn oil pressure pump is causing low oil pressure, and a faulty
    oil level sensor is giving false indications as to the oil quantity.
  - Two faults - The oil pressure transmitter is faulty, giving a false reading of
    low pressure, and the oil level sensor is also faulty, giving false readings of

  text: Why do large jet engines need a spool-up time?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - Because the engines are controlled by an electronic engine control unit, the calculations
    required to meter the correct amount of fuel produce a delay in the accelaration
    of the engine.
  - Due to the number of turbine blades in jet fans and the high viscosity of cold
    blades.
  - The engine gearbox requires a significant amount of the energy produced by the
    turbine; this causes a typical spool up time.
  - A request for a rapid acceleration may cause a flameout due to the overfly rich
    mixture.

  text: Consider a climb with a piston engine aeroplane. What will happen to the fuel
    flow if the pilot maintains the same power setting?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - With increasing altitude air density decreases and the power output of the engine
    decreases. This has to be compensated for by an increased fuel flow.
  - The temperature decreases and thereby over-compensates for the decreasing air
    density which is caused by the decreasing pressure. This results in a decreasing
    fuel flow.
  - The temperature decreases and thereby compensates for the decreasing air density
    which is caused by the decreasing pressure. Therefore the fuel flow remains the
    same.
  - With increasing altitude air density decreases, therefore less fuel is required
    for combustion, so the fuel flow decreases.
