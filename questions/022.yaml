  text: An aeroplane is making a high-speed descent at a constant Mach number. The
    airspeed is approaching the maximum allowed speed for the given atmospheric conditions.
    Is the maximum allowed speed likely to be exceeded, if the pilots keep their descent
    at a constant Mach Number?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - No, because the TAS will decrease as they descend.
  - Yes, because the TAS will increase as they descend.
  - Yes, and there is a risk of reaching supersonic speeds.
  - No, because the TAS will remain constant as they descend.

    representation of altitude. Why is that?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - The mathematical model used by the GPS is a very close approximation to, rather
    than a complete match with, the actual shape of the Earth.
  - If there are too many satellites in view, the excess information fails to coincide
    with that in the Almanac.
  - The height of the ionosphere interferes with the path lengths of the radio waves.
  - If there is an insufficient number of satellites in view, this can result in missing
    information and inconsistencies with the ephemeris data.

  text: A modern transport jet is flying at its cruising altitude of 37000 feet in
    normal cruise flight. Suddenly and without warning, the pilots realize that the
    autothrottle system moved the thrust levers to idle, accompanied with the FMA
    'RETARD' message. In order to control the situation, the pilot flying increases
    the thrust back to its initial position and takes over manual control of the thrust
    levers. What could be the probable cause of this issue?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - A total failure of the radio altimeter, I.e. NO output, which can cause unexpected
    behaviour WITHOUT warnings.
  - The autothrust/autothrottle computer has failed and as a consequence the default
    thrust setting of idle is applied automatically.
  - Spurious (Incorrect) radio altimeter indications, which can cause unexpected behaviour
    WITHOUT warnings.
  - The autothrust/autothrottle has automatically disengaged itself causing the engine

  text: A crew is operating an Airbus 320 aircraft with both right and left fuel tanks
    filled to their maximum capacity, which is the same for both tanks. During the
    flight, the co-pilot observes that the upper display indicates 900 kg of remaining
    fuel in the left tank, while the right tank still holds approximately 2 500 kg
    of fuel. What should the crew do in this situation?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - The crew should promptly assume that the fuel pump for the right engine is not
    supplying fuel and initiate a "Mayday Fuel" distress call.
  - The crew should exercise caution when considering opening the cross-feed valve
    due to the elevated risk of a fuel leak, which could potentially result in total
    fuel loss.
  - The engine with the higher fuel quantity should be shut down immediately, followed
    by opening the cross-feed valve.
  - The crew should promptly open the crossfeed valve to redistribute the fuel.

  - rely on carefully calibrated electromagnets to apply brakes to control inputs
    when pitch and bank angle limits are exceeded.
  - are NOT necessary on conventional control systems. In FBW systems, their sole

  - The pitch mode should be vertical speed to ensure sufficient climb rate to follow
    the departure profile, and the roll mode should be heading or track.
  - Pitch commands should be to obtain an attitude that achieved obstacle clearance,
    and the roll commands should follow the standard departure (SID).
  - Pitch commands should stabilise at a speed referenced to V2, and the roll commands

    (PM) makes the appropriate selections, which are verified by the PF. What should
    the PF do next?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - Turn towards POL, ignoring the FD. If the FD still commands any turn once the
    aircraft is tracking towards POL, ignore it, as this is common when flying direct
    to waypoints, and the FD roll command will eventually reduce.
  - Check on the FMA that the NAV mode is engaged, and that the FD commands a turn
    towards POL If it does NOT, ask the PM to set the heading or track mode and a
    suitable heading or track.
  - Turn 20º right, ignoring the FD roll command, and check on the ND that the aircraft
    is tracking towards POL. Check that the FD roll command is catching up with the
    turn and that the FMA shows NAV lateral mode is engaged.
  - Check that the FCU NAV button is illuminated. The FD will command a turn towards
    POL, so follow the FD and wait until the turn is commanded. ATC will expect a
    delay so will NOT need to be told.

    heat failed, with an annunciated alert, in the cruise. The screen is clear. What
    implications does the failure have on the briefing for the approach and landing?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - Because the failure was annunciated, if there is any consequent autoland capability
    downgrade, this will also be annunciated. In case autoland capability remains
    unchanged, a CAT III approach may be flown.
  - A check of the manuals is required, in case the defect causes a reduction in the
    aircraft's approach capability. Diversion, or a higher height and/or RVR might
    be necessary.
  - All aircraft systems are required to be serviceable for low visibility procedures,
    so diversion to a CAT I aerodrome will be necessary.
  - The autoland capability should NOT be affected by the windscreen heating failure,
    therefore NO action is necessary.

    description of the following two vertical modes?


    * Vertical speed (V/S)

    * Flight-Path Angle (FPA)'
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - Both modes will make the aeroplane maintain a selected vertical speed, which varies
    with the airspeed to maintain a constant flight-path angle.
  - V/S will maintain a rate of climb or descent as set by the pilot while FPA will
    maintain a flight-path angle as coded in the FMS.
  - Both modes will make the aeroplane follow a trajectory where V/S uses feet per
    minute as reference and FPA uses an angle.
  - V/S will maintain a selected airspeed during the climb or descent and FPA will
    maintain a selected geometric flight-path angle during climb or descent.

  text: 'Explain how the mixed mode works and what inputs it needs:'
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - In the mixed mode for the vertical path, the autopilot uses a pitch attitude (or
    pitch attitude rate) which allows it to avoid a tail-strike during take off, and
    for the lateral path, it uses the localizer signal to keep the runway centreline.
  - The mixed mode uses a constant vertical speed to ensure the obstacle clearance
    and uses a heading/track mode to keep the centreline of the runway.
  - It works on the same principle as the CWS and reduces the pilot’s workload for
    flight path management.
  - The mixed modes are exclusively used for the low visibility take-off and landing.

  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - a delay of 5 seconds occurs while the autopilot motors the auto-trim up and down,
    until the trim position has been identified.
  - a pitch-up trim load is always maintained by the autopilot, ensuring the deviation
    when the autopilot disconnects is predictable and consistent.
  - trim is mechanically centred, ensuring that the full range of movement is available
    to the auto-trim system.
  - engagement occurs only if the aircraft is in trim, with control loads very low.
