  text: What are the possible consequences when loading an aircraft incorrectly so
    that its CG is positioned behind the aft limit?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - There may be insufficient aft pitch control available to keep the aircraft level
    in straight flight.
  - There may be insufficient forward pitch control available to keep the aircraft
    level in straight flight.
  - There may be an inability to flare the aircraft on landing.
