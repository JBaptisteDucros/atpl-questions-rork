  options:
  - It is NOT legal to commence a take-off run with a thrust setting other than the
    one calculated as the take-off performance cannot be assured using incorrect speeds.
  - The aeroplane will have an improved climb performance but because the speeds are
    calculated for a reduced thrust setting, the aeroplane will fail to achieve the
    required take-off distance and obstacle clearance.
  - The take-off speeds will be incorrect and too low. If an engine were to fail at
    the most critical time for a continued take-off, the aeroplane would fail to achieve
    the calculated performance.
  - The engine will achieve a higher thrust setting and take-off performance will
    be improved when compared to the calculated values.

  text: A jet aircraft is experiencing buffet whilst flying at its aerodynamic ceiling
    (coffin corner). What is the recommended recovery for this?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - Maintain current thrust setting and descend. Increasing TAS is acceptable, but
    a decreased TAS will cause a stall.
  - Maintain thrust and commence a turn at a 30º bank angle. The drag increase will
    cause a descent without significantly affecting the manoeuvre margins.
  - Reduce thrust, maintain IAS and descent. Any increase or decrease in IAS could
    increase the buffet.
  - Reduce thrust, maintain current TAS and descend. Either increasing or decreasing
    TAS could cause high-speed or low-speed buffet.

  text: A Medium-Range Jet Transport aeroplane is planned to depart from a sufficiently
    long runway and the correct V-speeds have been calculated. The pilot has not flown
    this variant of the aircraft before, and it has a longer fuselage than the variant
    they have flown before. As the tail clearance during rotation is reduced on this
    longer aircraft, the pilot performs their rotation at a slightly slower (but still
    acceptable) rate than they would normally. What will this change?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - It will increase the take-off run, but the take-off distance will be reduced since
    the aeroplane will attain a climb speed that is slightly faster.
  - It will improve the climb performance of the aeroplane as this procedure is effectively
    the same as using an increased V2 procedure.
  - It will increase both the take-off run and the take-off distance and potentially
    reduce the clearance over low obstacles close to the runway.

    A flight crew of a performance class A aeroplane are preparing for departure.
    Only the Captain has run the performance figures using an application on their
    electronic flight bag (EFB), and has not crosschecked the results with the first
    officer, who is busy preparing the departure routing. That aircraft''s take-off
    mass is 68 000 kg, so is under the MTOM with reduced thrust setting of 68 262
    kg that the Captain has calculated. The V-speeds for departure can be seen on
    the annex above, which is a small extract from the EFB performance tool. The V**MCG**
    is 118 kt.


    When inputting the V-speeds into the FMS, the Captain enters 140 kt for V**1**.
    During take-off, the pilot monitoring calls V**1** at the FMS selected V**1**
    speed, at which point an engine failure occurs. The engine failure is detected
    and acted upon at an airspeed of 143 kt.

  - The Captain will reject the take-off because that is the recommended option when
    an engine fails during the take-off roll, but the accelerate-stop distance will
    be longer than the one calculated by the EFB.
  - The pilot flying will continue the take-off and the take-off distance required
    will be larger than the one calculated by the EFB, since the engine failure occurred
    at a speed below the correct V1.
  - The Captain will reject the take-off because the failure happens less than 2 seconds
    after V1, but the accelerate-stop distance required will be larger than the one

  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - The Standard strategy gives the shortest time in the descent to reach the drift-down
    level-off altitude.
  - The Standard strategy ensures that the greatest excess thrust is available to
    reduce the rate of descent.
  - For the ETOPS strategy, the aeroplane must accelerate to the descent speed before
    commencing the descent.
  - For the Obstacle strategy, decelerating to VMD before commencing the descent improves

    \ \nV2: 139 kt"
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - SEL OAT is a parameter that is used to modify the take-off performance calculation
    in order find the appropriate thrust setting and is NOT entered in any aeroplane
    systems. The aeroplane can only work with the actual air temperature.
  - SEL OAT wil force the engine control computer to think the air temprature is +59ºC
    and therefore that the air density is low and the engine requires less fuel to
    maintain the correct fuel/air ratio. This leads to less thrust being produced.
  - The SEL value will only be considered when it is lower than the air temprature
    at the airport. it is the lowest of either the SEL OAT or the airport air temprature
    that determines the take-off thrust for the engines.
  - By entering the SEL OAT value the engine will produce a greater amount of thrust
    since a higher SEL OAT value will tell the engine that the air is warmer. This
    means that more fuel is required to maintain the thrust when the air is less dense.

  options:
  - The climb gradient is based on the net climb gradient, increased to account for
    a safety margin.
  - The net climb gradient is based on flight tests only.
  - The net climb gradient is based on the gross climb gradient, reduced to account
    for safety margins based on the number of engines.

  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - RWY 03 is field-length limited and even with a headwind it will be more limiting
    than the field length for runway 21.
  - RWY 03 is climb limited with the obstacle for runway 03 having a greater influence
    even if it is further away compared to the obstacle for runway 21.
  - RWY 03 is obstacle-limited and even with the headwind the limiting obstacles have
    more influence than taking off on runway 21 with a tailwind.
  - RWY 03 is climb limited because only 50% of the headwind is accounted for, which
    has a lesser effect than, for runway 21, 150% of the tailwind component.

  text: This formula for calculating the dynamic hydroplaning speed distinguishes
    between rotating and non-rotating tyres. Which of the following statements best
    describes the most limiting speed for an aircraft operating on a wet runway?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - Hydroplaning speed is lowest for low-pressure rotating tyres and can be calculated
    using the aircraft mass multiplied by the tyre pressure.
  - The hydroplaning speed of rotating tyres is lower, because there is a higher risk
    of hydroplaning during the roll-out phase.
  - Hydroplaning speed depends only on the amount of standing water and tyre rotation,
    and can be calculated using the aircraft mass multiplied by the amount of standing
    water.
  - The hydroplaning speed of non-rotating tyres is lower, because there is a higher
    risk of hydroplaning immediately following wheel spin-up during touchdown.

  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - The RTOW tables are typically older and therefore NOT suitable for use in a modern
    aeroplane where a lot of processes are automated.
  - Performance figures from the RTOW tables are more conservative as they include
    a safety factor of 1.15 that is NOT applied in the EFB calculations.
  - EFB calculations are more accurate and will therefore produce more conservative
    performance figures than retrieved from RTOW tables.

  text: During a 6-hour flight sector from North Africa to Europe, an airplane is

    Typically, the optimum cruising altitude is between 500 ft and 2 500 ft below
    the recommended maximum, and the maximum altitude recommendation increases by
    100 ft for every 10 minutes of flight time as the fuel burns off. However, in
    this scenario, the Flight Management System (FMS) suggests an optimal altitude
    of FL340 for the entire flight. What could be the reason for the FMS not recommending
    a step climb to FL370 or higher?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - Due to the aircraft being too heavy, it is not possible to climb by 2 000 ft to
    higher altitudes during the flight.
  - Typically, it is more fuel-efficient to fly at lower altitudes to take advantage
    of a higher TAS for the same Mach number.
  - The unfavorable wind component at higher altitudes can offset the increased fuel
    burn at the lower altitude.
  - Due to incorrect programming of the aircraft weights, the FMS is providing inaccurate

  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - Climb with a constant IAS/CAS has to be levelled off to achieve a given Mach number
    at this altitude.
  - The cross over altitude is the only pressure altitude where a certain IAS/CAS
    matches the same Mach number in any atmospheric condition.
  - During climb with a constant speed, a constant IAS/CAS is changed to a constant
    Mach number at this altitude.

  text: A light twin piston-engined aeroplane is cruising at 2000 ft when one of its
    engines fails. Whilst the pilot is performing the necessary actions to secure
    the engine, they observe that the aircraft is in a very slow descent, even with
    their operative engine at maximum continuous power. What is the reason for this?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - The power required has reduced because drag is increased by the stationary propeller
    and the required control inputs to maintain direction, and the remaining engine
    has sufficient excess power.
  - The power available has reduced because the feathered propeller only produces
    a small amount of thrust compared to normal and therefore the power required is
    less than the power available.
  - The pilot must NOT have feathered the propeller of the failed engine, because
    ALL twin-engined aeroplanes that are certified in accordance with CS-23 must be
    able to climb within their environmental envelope.
  - The increased drag from the propeller of the failed engine and the required control
    inputs to maintain direction mean that the power from the remaining engine is
    insufficient to maintain altitude.

  text: Consider a climb with a piston engine aeroplane. What will happen to the fuel
    flow if the pilot maintains the same power setting?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - With increasing altitude air density decreases, therefore less fuel is required
    for combustion, so the fuel flow decreases.
  - With increasing altitude air density decreases and the power output of the engine
    decreases. This has to be compensated for by an increased fuel flow.
  - The temperature decreases and thereby over-compensates for the decreasing air
    density which is caused by the decreasing pressure. This results in a decreasing
    fuel flow.
  - The temperature decreases and thereby compensates for the decreasing air density
    which is caused by the decreasing pressure. Therefore the fuel flow remains the
    same.

  text: A pilot is planning to fly a light aircraft to an airport with a short runway,
    but which is long enough to land safely. The pilot is accustomed to landing at
    airports with long or very long runways and a mixture of small and large aeroplanes,
    where ATC often asks small aircraft to maintain a high approach speed to facilitate
    traffic flow. If the pilot flies as per their regular habit (with a high approach
    speed) when landing on the short runway…
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - the landing is more likely to be successful since the safety factors account for
    any inaccuracies in speed and touchdown point and therefore assure a safe landing.
  - the landing must be completed such that the aeroplane touches down before the
    normal touchdown point in order to allow for a greater braking distance after
    landing.
  - there is NO risk of runway excursion if the aeroplane touches down at the optimum
    touchdown point because the brakes are able to absorb greater energy.
  - there is a large risk of runway excursion as a higher-than-optimum approach speed
    increases the risk of floating with significant additional kinetic energy dissipating.

  text: Which of the following options correctly describes the effects on aircraft
    performance of landing on wet or contaminated runways?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - The effect of the increased wheel drag through the water is far greater than the
    loss of friction and reduced braking effect, therefore landing distances decrease.
  - Hydroplaning creates more drag on the wheels, which is evenly balanced by less
    effective brake drag, thus creating a similar deceleration force compared to a
    dry runway.
  - The lower effective braking force has a much greater effect on increasing the
    landing distance than the benefit of higher drag.
  - The coefficient of friction is dramatically increased, which reduces the maximum
    braking energy that can be applied, which increases the landing distance.

  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - The departure can be continued because the planned take-off mass is based on a
    calculation that included the maximum tailwind.
  - The take-off can be commenced because the updated wind means that the new headwind
    has increased the take-off performance and therefore increased the maximum FLLTOM.
  - The approximate headwind of 15 kt means the aircraft should return to stand because
    the actual take-off distance has decreased and therefore the take-off mass can
    be increased.

    crosswind to 30 kt headwind. Ignoring any other factors, what will be the effect
    of the wind change on the aeroplane during the turning manoeuvre?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - The thrust will reduce in order to maintain 180 kt CAS and the vertical speed
    should be reduced to maintain trajectory as groundspeed decreases.
  - The aeroplane will balloon and the thrust will increase to compensate for the
    increased drag while following the trajectory, since that is unaffected by wind.
  - The ground speed will increase due to the increasing CAS and the aeroplane will
    become high on the descent profile, requiring less thrust.
  - More flaps should be extended to arrest the increasing airspeed and the rate of
    descent must be increased to maintain the optimum trajectory.
