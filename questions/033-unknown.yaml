  text: During a flight, a pilot decides to make an unplanned diversion due to passenger
    illness. The route to the alternate requires them to turn 90 degrees away from
    the planned track and fly for 50 nm. What altitude should the pilot choose to
    ensure a safe clearance from terrain and man-made structures?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - GRID MORA only provides a clearance of 1000 ft in areas where the highest elevations
    are 5000 ft MSL or lower.
  - MORA, because it provides clearance over terrain and man-made structures on either
    side of the route centreline up to 2000 ft.
  - Grid Minimum Off-Route Altitude (GRID MORA), because it provides clearance from
    terrain and man-made obstacles over a wider area.

  text: A CAT flight is on final approach to the destination aerodrome. ATC issued
    an instruction to go around, but NO further delays are expected. During the MAP,
    it becomes apparent that a new landing CANNOT be completed with Alternate Fuel
    plus Final Reserve Fuel remaining on landing. What is the best decision for the
    commander to take?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - Enter a holding pattern to minimise the fuel flow while deciding whether it is
    possible to land at destination with sufficient fuel remaining.
  - Re-plan as a flight without an alternate aerodrome, provided a landing can be
    made with Final reserve plus 15 minutes remaining.
  - Perform a landing at the destination provided the landing can be assured and completed
    with at least Final reserve Fuel remaining.
  - Divert to the alternate to ensure a landing can be completed with Contingency
    Fuel intact as per the rule on fuel policy.

  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - LP is a 3D approach, similar to VNAV.
  - There is no significant difference as both use GNSS as reference, so the pilot
    may choose the one with lowest minima.
  - LNAV offers both lateral and vertical guidance.
  - LP follows the Localiser Performance standards, which requires additional equipment
    on board the aircraft, beyond the standard GNSS.

    What impact does this message have on the flight?'
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - A new satellite will be added to the GPS constellation, but this has NO impact
    on the flight.
  - EGNOS SBAS will only use one of the two available satellites, and the range of
    GNSS services is reduced.
  - There is a major outage of GPS, greatly reducing GNSS achievability and therefore
    significantly impacting the flight.
  - There is an outage of a particular GPS satellite, but GNSS should still be fully
    achievable.

  text: Explain the basic idea of the predetermined point procedure (PDP).
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - The predetermined point procedure (PDP) requires the operator to predetermine
    a point at which a flight must divert to the alternate aerodrome when it is calculated
    in a fuel check that it has used some of its contingency fuel. It therefore increases
    flight safety by increase of the fuel that is still on board overhead the planned
    destination.
  - 'The predetermined point procedure (PDP) provides an option to select an aerodrome
    as destination alternate which is at a distance from the


    planned destination that it cannot be reached after first flying to the destination.
    It therefore increases maximum range by reduction of mandatory fuel reserves.'
  - The predetermined point procedure (PDP) permits planning of a flight to a destination
    where no alternate is available. When the aircraft reaches the predetermined point,
    the probability to land at the destination must be almost certain, or the aircraft
    has to return to its departure.
  - The predetermined point procedure (PDP) is a procedure where the flight is not
    planned to the intended destination but to a closer aerodrome, and fuel, including
    contingency fuel, is computed to this aerodrome. The additional fuel to the real
    destination is taken as “extra”.At the predetermined point, the flight is “replanned”
    to the intended destination. It therefore increases payload by reduction of required
    contingency fuel.

  text: The commander decides to increase the Block Fuel by 1 200 kg due to an expected
    holding at the destination aerodrome as this equates to approximately 30 minutes
    of holding. After take-off, the FMS indicates that there is only 27 minutes of
    extra holding fuel despite the payload being as originally planned. What is the
    reason for this?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - The Flight is NOT following its original route and shortcuts increase the Trip
    Fuel.
  - The FMC gives inaccurate results of calculations and therefore it cannot be relied
    on.
  - The Extra Fuel has made the aeroplane heavier, thus the Trip fuel is increased.
  - There is a stronger tailwind component than planned, leading to an increase of
    Trip Fuel.

    An aeroplane is performing a commercial air transport flight. Regular fuel checks
    performed approximately every 30 min as required by the operator. The flight follows
    the planned route and the flies at the mach number as planned. The fuel measurements
    are accurate within +/- 20 kg and the fuel flow indicators show a constant 1340
    kg/h per engine throughout.


    What is the reason for the creation of the position of PBD05 + 10 min?'
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - The aeroplane has less fuel than required but the fuel flow is verified as correct
    enabling a reasonable conclusion that any discrepancy is due to the wind being
    different to planned.
  - The fuel flow appear to be gradually increasing and one way of verifying this
    is to create a waypoint based on time and use the last known fuel depletion rate
    to assess any trends.
  - The fuel flow is confirmed to be different from the plan and therefore the fuel
    flow indicators are showing incorrect and the thrust can be reduced to match the
    planned fuel flow.
  - The fuel flow appear to be gradually reducing and in order to verify a revised
    fuel flow of 2850 kg/h the new waypoint enables this and a revised landing fuel
    may be calculated.

    flight with regard to fuel in case of a diversion?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - Remaining fuel should be at least the same as that required to return to the aerodrome
    or operating site of departure.
  - Remaining fuel should be at least the same as that required to reach at least
    two different aerodromes or operating sites where a safe landing can be made,
    one of which can be the aerodrome or operating site of departure.
  - As a diversion is a spontaneous event, it is a criterion that lies outside of
    the commander’s responsibilities with regard to fuel to be on board.
  - Remaining fuel should be at least the same as that required to reach an aerodrome
    or operating site where a safe landing can be made, with final reserve fuel remaining.
