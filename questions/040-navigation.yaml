    and a young, inexperienced co-pilot are assigned to fly together and have all
    received a briefing that includes weather information, what is the recommended
    course of action next?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - It is crucial for the Captain to engage in a discussion about potential flight
    threats with both co-pilots.
  - There is no need for further discussion since all members of the flight crew have
    been provided with the same information.
  - The Captain should specifically have a discussion with the experienced co-pilot
    only.

    call-out, but the pilot monitoring does not hear the call-out. What has happened?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - A communication error from the pilot flying, who must not make any call-outs while
    the pilot monitoring is busy with other tasks.
  - A communication threat, because communication with ATC uses up cockpit resources
    and creates a risk of human overload.
  - A communication threat, because the disruption prevented the crew from communicating
    the changes to maintain a shared mental picture.
  - A procedural error from the pilot monitoring, who must not direct his attention

    of a flight, claiming that he/she violated established operating procedures by
    landing with insufficient fuel on board. The captain can plausibly demonstrate
    that he/she has only made a mistake when documenting the fuel mass in the technical
    logbook after the flight, while the actual fuel on board after landing was well

    work for 10 days.


    Which of the following statements is correct with regard to the operator''s safety
    culture?'
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - 'The operator does not apply the principle of “just culture”: to foster trust
    and collaboration. Such an unintended slip should be reported and discussed to
    prevent their future re-occurrence, it should not be punished.'
  - In a “just culture” environment, the punishment of an employee for making an error
    is an example of bad management; errors and violations should not be punished
    in order to promote an atmosphere of trust.
  - The operator demonstrates an adequate concern towards safety and considers negligent
    behavior as unacceptable. Negligence displays a lack of awareness of risks and
    hazards, probably reducing the safety margin in flight.
  - The operator efficiently applies the principle of “just culture”, fairly punishing
    negligent behavior as a form of positive control. This can motivate employees
    to be more careful before taking action and promote risk awareness.

    is something wrong, the angle of bank has exceeded 35°, and the crew are already
    spatially disoriented. How may this be explained?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - If the rolling acceleration is greater than 8° per second, the vestibular receptors
    of the pilots may fail to detect the variation in the angle of bank, being below
    the sensory threshold.
  - With flying experience, the vestibular sensory threshold of their pilots decreases,
    leading to reduced sensitivity to stimuli related to attitude changes of the aircraft.
  - The aircraft's rolling acceleration is so slow that it remains below the vestibular
    sensory threshold, so the crew fail to detect the change in the angle of bank.
  - A variation in the bank angle of the aircraft should be perceived when it exceeds
    8°, which is the average sensory threshold for a healthy adult.

    control tower to dim the runway lights, as he/she realises that his/her capacity
    to judge the distance from the runway is diminished. Is that request justified?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - No, because the pupil will narrow quickly due to the bright runway lights, reducing
    the amount of light entering the eye, and enabling the cones to function properly.
  - No, because the focussing process relies on the amount of light passing through
    the cornea and pupil, and so the light intensity is important for depth perception.
  - Yes, because the lens needs time to accommodate a different light intensity, and
    the ability to focus is affected by changes in the light intensity.
  - Yes, because depth perception may be impaired if the rods and cones on the retina
    are exposed to bright light after dark adaptation.

    body will have trouble transporting oxygen in the blood.
  - Carbon monoxide is toxic to the nervous system and will cause brain damage.
  - Haemoglobin has a much greater affinity to bind with carbon monoxide than with
    oxygen. The pilot will suffer from carbon monoxide poisoning and have difficulties
    in transporting oxygen around the body.
  - Carbon monoxide inhalation causes a build up of carbonic acid in the blood, leading
    to hyperventilation and dizziness. These symptoms will clear, so it does not represent
    a serious threat to the pilot.

  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - Prolonged exposure to cabin noise may lead to NIHL (Noise Induced Hearing Loss),
    which involves damage to the receptors in the cochlea.
  - High noise levels in flight, exceeding 90 dB, cause strong vibrations in the ear
    that can result in CHL (Conductive Hearing Loss).
  - Over-exposure to very loud noises from the engine exhaust can cause CHL (Conductive
    Hearing Loss), where damage to the auditory nerve prevents transmission of sound.
  - Long-term exposure to high volumes of noise produced by the aircraft engines /
    rotors can cause NIHL (Noise Induced Hearing Loss), which involves damage to the

  text: A pilot is invited to have a session in a spatial disorientation training
    device. Such a device can rotate around any of its 3 axes (or multiple at once),
    and the pilot has no visual reference to the outside. When the device is rotating
    around only the vertical axis (yawing), the pilot is asked to nod their head up
    and down. They very quickly become dizzy and disorientated. Why does this happen?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - The nodding of the head disturbs the equilibrium of all the sensory inputs. This
    can be compensated for by the brain for a certain time, after which, disorientation
    will begin.
  - The process of interpreting vestibular sensations in the brain's cerebral cortex
    is adversely affected by the pilot nodding their head, leading to disorientation.
  - The dizziness and disorientation is caused solely by the rotation of the device
    without external visual reference, the nodding of the head does not influence
    this effect.
  - Without any outside visual references, the interaction between their individual
    senses becomes disturbed by nodding their head while the device is rotating.

    parts of the auditory system after sound waves enter through the outer ear?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - The eardrum separates the ear canal from the cochlea, where the sound waves are
    translated into mechanical impulses. These are transmitted via auditory tubes
    to receptors in the brain.
  - Sound waves cause the eardrum to vibrate. Ossicles transmit the vibrations to
    the cochlea, which translates them into electrical impulses. The auditory nerve
    carries the impulses to the brain.
  - Sound waves travel via the ear canal to the eardrum. Mechanical vibrations are
    translated into fluid vibrations in the cochlea. The Eustachian tube connects
    the auditory system with the brain.
  - Travelling through the semi-circular ear canal, sound waves strike the eardrum,
    causing it to vibrate. The cochlea translates the sound into pressure waves. Cranial
    nerves carry the waves to the brain.

    they should consider with regards to their flying duties on the return flight?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - No. As passenger aircraft are pressurised, the pilot can conduct a flight immediately
    after diving.
  - Yes. If a flight must be made within 24 hours of a dive, oxygen-enriched air must
    be used whilst diving, and a flight can then be made after only 6 hours.
  - Yes, the pilot must wait at least 24 hours between diving and flying.
  - Yes, the pilot should only perform one dive to avoid compression sickness during
    flight.

    of the following is a hazard in this scenario?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - The pilot could be affected by illusions due to atmospheric perspective.
  - The pilot may become dangerously low, leading to potentially dangerous situations,
    even in VFR conditions.
  - The pilot will find it difficult to correctly judge their groundspeed, leading

    day with clear sky and good visibility, the passengers request the pilot to divert
    to capture photographs of the mountain on their left. What risk should the pilot
    remain cautious of?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - Constant attention must be paid to the aircraft's height above the ground, as
    there is a risk of underestimating the height in good visibility conditions, possibly
    leading to hazardous low-level flight.
  - The pilot should carefully assess the range, as he/she could underestimate the
    distance of the aircraft from the mountains due to the atmospheric perspective.
  - The mountains will appear closer due to the aerial perspective, and the pilot
    must pay attention to avoid inadvertently reducing airspeed as the aircraft approaches
    the sloping ground of the mountains.
  - The aerial perspective makes the mountains seem smaller than they actually are,
    with the risk of NOT being able to reach a safe altitude to cross them.

    When the pilot visits his/her AME, the measurement and recording of blood pressure
    is mandatory. Why is that?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - If the diastolic pressure value is found to be below 100 mm Hg, a state of hypotension
    is diagnosed, and the pilot could be unable to fly if that value remains so low.
  - With a blood pressure measurement of 140/90 mm Hg, a pilot is to be considered
    temporarily unfit, because of the high risk of fainting in flight due to very
    low diastolic pressure.
  - Should the systolic pressure exceed the value of 160 mm Hg, a state of hypertension
    is diagnosed, which may lead to cardiovascular failure, with the risk of incapacitation
    during flight.
  - A blood pressure measurement of 90/60 mm Hg may be dangerous with a high risk

  - It is the most dangerous form of incapacitation as it may remain undetected by
    the other pilot(s) in a multicrew cockpit.
  - Frequent medical screening can reduce the hazard caused by insidious incapacitation
    as most of the medical causes can be detected before flight safety is affected.

  - Diastolic pressure is the lowest measurable pressure exerted by the heart on the
    vein walls, when the blood flows towards the heart to be re-oxygenated.
  - Systolic pressure is generated by the contractions of the heart, when it pumps
    blood towards the periphery of the body, and it is the highest pressure value.

  text: Is it possible to survive depressurised flight at 40000 feet for more than
    10 minutes?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - Yes – because the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood is independent of that
    in the lungs.
  - No – because the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the lung alveoles at 40000
    feet is lower than in the blood, causing carbon dioxide to flow backwards from
    blood to lungs, depleting the brain of its oxygen.
  - Yes – provided 100 % oxygen under pressure is immediately available from masks.
  - No – because the brain can never receive sufficient oxygen at 40000 feet, even
    with an oxygen mask.

  text: An aerodrome is located near to the southern edge of a large town. Directly

    is straight-in, from the south, over a large unpopulated desert. What hazard should
    the pilots be aware of when approaching the aerodrome?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - The absence of visual cues can give the illusion that the aircraft is too low,
    this illusion can be reinforced at night by the relative position of the approach
    lights in front of the background light of the populated areas, with the risk
    of descending too slowly and overshooting the runway.
  - In night VFR, over the dark desert, the visual illusion of being too low, with
    the risk of descending too slowly and overshooting the runway, and even attempting
    to go around.
  - In day or night VFR, the possibility of suffering from the "black hole" illusion,
    where the runway lights appear in the pilot's windshield at a higher position
    than is expected, with the risk of being too high on the approach and making a
    very steep descent.
  - In night VFR, the visual illusion of being too high due to the runway lights appearing
    to be in a lower position than expected on the windscreen, and the risk of descending
    too early and landing short.

    The pilot immediately restores level flight, however feels that he/she is turning
    left. What is being described?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - This is a somatogravic illusion, which involves angular accelerations lasting
    for more than 30 seconds, giving the false sensation of being in straight and
    level flight while the aircraft is actually turning.
  - This is an illusion caused by a malfunction of the vestibular system that usually
    occurs when visual reference is lost for more than 30 seconds and the pilot is
    NOT trained in reduced visibility.
  - 'This is a vestibular illusion called the "leans", which can occur during VFR
    and IFR flights: it must be counteracted by referring to the instruments, since
    the false sensation of bank may last for quite a while.'
  - This is "the leans", a vestibular illusion that does NOT occur during VFR flight,
    because outside visual cues are present, and sight is the most important sense
    to rely on in case of conflicting sensorial information.

    this statement correct or incorrect and why?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - Correct, because we habitually trust all senses equally, which can disturb our
    sensory system when all sensory inputs seem equally strong.
  - Incorrect, because each sensory input acts independently as a standalone input;
    therefore, the spatial orientation of a pilot is not affected.
  - Correct, because we normally trust vision as our primary and most accurate sense,
    even when other sensory inputs are conflicting.
  - Incorrect, because interaction between the senses is coordinated by the brain,

    the approach, and how should they proceed safely?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - The pilot will feel that they are further out on the descent path and may reduce
    thrust too late, resulting in an overshoot. They should pay careful attention
    to their approach speed.
  - The pilot may have the impression that they are above the correct approach path,
    resulting in an increased rate of descent and possible undershoot. They should
    believe their instruments.
  - The pilot may believe that they are flying too fast, resulting in an early thrust
    reduction and lack of energy. They should be careful not to reduce below the specified
    approach speed.
  - The pilot will be able to correctly assess their relative position and speed,
    but may be unaware of the increased landing distance required. They should consult
    their performance charts before the flight to ensure that the aircraft can safely

  text: An aircraft is making a visual approach to an aerodrome with a runway that

    to, when the aircraft is lined up for an approach to this aerodrome?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - The illusion that the aircraft is too low on the approach with the risk of flying
    at a shallower angle than normal and of landing beyond the touchdown area. In
    addition, the narrow width could cause the pilot to misjudge the height above
    the runway and make a heavy landing.
  - Initially the illusion that the aircraft is higher on the approach than it should
    be, but because the runway is also sloping up towards the stop end, the illusion
    in the later stages of the approach of the aircraft being too low. Overall there
    is a risk that a steeper approach is made followed by a late flare by the pilot.
  - The runway slope should NOT influence the pilot's perception, but narrowness of
    the runway could give the illusion of being too low, with the risk that the flare
    is executed later than normal.
  - The illusion that the aircraft is higher on the approach than it should be, with
    the risk of flying a steeper than normal approach and landing short of the touchdown

  text: The visual approach to a high altitude aerodrome requires a relatively tight
    right turn, to avoid highground to the left. When lined up with the runway, the
    approach continues over terrain that slopes down to the runway threshold. What
    visual illusion could be associated with this approach?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - The proximity to the terrain below the aircraft, when at the correct height for
    the approach, can create the illusion that the aircraft is too low; the pilot
    might reduce the rate of descent and land beyond the normal touchdown point.
  - The slope of the terrain down to the threshold can create an illusion that the
    rate of descent is too high and, in attempting to correct for the illusion, the
    pilot could make the approach more shallow and land short of the runway.
  - The proximity to the terrain during the approach can create the illusion that
    the aircraft is too low and, in response, the pilot could reduce the approach
    speed and fly a flatter approach, risking to land short of the normal touchdown
    area.
  - The late view of the terrain below the aircraft, on completion of the right turn,
    can create the illusion that the aircraft has increased height during the turn
    and, in response to this illusion, the pilot could make the descent steeper and
    land short.

  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - When the pilot is scanning the area ahead and on either side of the aircraft,
    with an unobscured field of view, another aircraft on a constant relative bearing
    could be lost in the blind spot of either eye.
  - If the pilot's vision remains focused on one area of the sky with an unobscured
    view, and another aircraft is on a crossing course ahead, the other aircraft could
    be lost in the blind spot.
  - The possibility of another aircraft on a constant relative bearing being lost
    in the blind spot is increased if the pilot's focus of view remains in one direction
    and one eye is partially or completely obscured.
  - The effect of the blind spot can be problematic by day, but at night this problem
    does NOT occur because of the use of aircraft lights.

  text: When does the blind spot on the retina become significant for a pilot?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - When flying in conditions of low forward visibility, the existence of the blind
    spot on the retina of each eye can make the judgement of the distance of other
    traffic more difficult for the pilot.
  - When an aircraft is approaching from head-on, it will disappear for a moment as
    it passes the blind spot on the retina. It will remain undetected until the relative
    position of the aircraft changes.
  - If another aircraft is on a converging course and the pilot's field of view is
    restricted on one side, the pilot might fail to see the other aircraft if it is
    positioned in the blind spot of the unobstructed eye.
  - If the pilot's vision is unrestricted and is focused directly ahead, in conditions
    of low forward visibility, the aircraft converging its track may go undetected
    if it falls in the blind spot of the eye.

    their medical certificate. During the examination, the AME discovers that the
    pilot has difficulties hearing certain frequencies, especially in the high pitched
    range of speech, whilst many other frequencies remain unaffected. When asked,
    the pilot admits that they have regularly been doing their outside inspections
    without wearing any ear protection. Which kind of hearing loss is most likely
    to have occured?

    slower than it really is; this kind of illusion is caused by atmospheric perspective.
  - The pilot could think that the aircraft is moving when it has already stopped,
    due to autokinesis, which occurs when visual references are poor or absent.
  - The pilot could over-estimate the aircraft's groundspeed, this is a cognitive
    illusion, caused by perceived relative movement.

  text: It is inadvisable to fly when suffering from a cold. The reason for this is..
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - swollen tissue in the inner ear will increase the rate of metabolic production,
    resulting in hyperventilation.
  - because it will seriously affect peripheral vision.
  - although the change in air pressure during a climb at lower altitudes is very
    small, it increases rapidly at high altitudes. If the tissue in the Eustachian
    tube of the ear is swollen, gentle descents at high altitude would result in damage
    to the ear drum.
  - the tissue around the nasal end of the Eustachian tube is likely to be swollen
    thus causing difficulty in equalising the pressure within the middle ear and the
    nasal/throat area. Pain and damage to the eardrum can result, particularly during
    fast descents.

    an airline. He/she wakes up with a cold. Instead of calling in sick, he/she begins
    his/her duty. What is the greatest risk of flying when having a cold?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - A barotrauma of the sinuses commonly occurs during rapid climbs at low altitudes,
    accompanied by a feeling of pressure or sharp pain around the nose, eyes and jaws.
  - When the Eustachian tubes are swollen, pressure may probably equalise in one ear
    but not in the other, putting different pressures on the vestibule systems and
    causing spatial disorientation.
  - Otic barotrauma can cause pain in the ears and loss of hearing in rapid climbs
    at low altitude.
  - Barodontalgia is very common when suffering from a cold. The swollen tissues of
    the throat and nose do not allow for sufficient pressure equalisation, causing
    pain when the outside pressure changes too rapidly.

    the pilot's performance and vigilance likely to be affected by the circadian rhythm
    during the maximum duty day?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - On a duty day starting at 15:00 local time, a pilot's performance and vigilance
    tend to be at their lowest level in accordance with the circadian cycle, and thereafter
    increase continuously towards the end of the duty day.
  - The performance and vigilance of a pilot whose duty day starts near the low point
    of the circadian cycle is likely to be at a fairly high level to begin with, but
    is likely to reduce as the duty day progresses.
  - A pilot's performance, including vigilance, on a duty day starting at 12:00 local
    time, will tend to start at a high level and remain constant at that level throughout
    the duty day.
  - For a duty day commencing at 09:00 local time, both performance and vigilance

    to sleep patterns is correct?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - When the body temperature rises it takes longer to fall asleep, but the sleep
    will be of better quality and longer duration. Because body temperature rises
    in the evening it is better to go to bed early in the evening.
  - The circadian variation in body temperature is the same for most people (who are
    adapted to the local time and work/sleep cycle). It is critical for determining
    the timing, duration and therefore quality of sleep.
  - The daily variation in body temperature is the most important circadian rhythm
    for sleep, and it varies significantly among individuals. A pilot should recognise
    his/her personal pattern in order to effectively plan sleep timing and duration.
  - The circadian variation in body temperature is the same for most people (who are
    adapted to the local time and work/sleep cycle). Morning sunlight synchronises
    the body temperature rhythm to the local time, allowing a person to quickly adjust
    to the local time zone.

  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - The internal clock is affected by periodic changes of physical parameters such
    as body temperature, resting heart rate or digestion.
  - The internal clock modifies the “free-running” circadian rhythm to match the actual
    length of the day.
  - The internal clock is responsible for the occurrence of jetlag, as it prevents
    rapid adjustment to new time zones.
  - The internal clock regulates the duration of the circadian rhythm to about 23
    to 28 hours, whereat the average duration is 25 hours.

  text: The crew of an aircraft encounters total loss of both electrical power generators.
    The electrical sources remaining are the batteries which are designed to provide
    power for 30 minutes. The crew detects the failure but does NOT complete the check-list
    and does not disconnect non-essential electrical equipment. The nearest suitable
    aerodrome is 20 minutes away, but the Commander decides to continue to destination,
    which is 30 minutes away. During the approach to the destination aerodrome a complete
    electrical failure is encountered and critical flight instruments are lost. Which
    statements best describes the decision-making errors in this scenario?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - The crew misinterpret the situation, and the decision to continue to the destination
    is a consequence of this. Since they do NOT collect and evaluate all the relevant
    information about the electrical failure, a review of their decision is NOT necessary.
  - 'The error lies in the implementation phase of the decision-making process: the
    decision to continue to the destination is a good one, since the batteries should
    last for 30 minutes, but the crew fail to follow the flight plan.'
  - The crew correctly recognise the failure, but they act incorrectly regarding the
    checklist, they fail to properly assess the risk associated with the problem,
    they poorly evaluate the available options, and they fail to review their decision.
  - Once the crew decide on their course of action, they fail to review their choice.
    In this type of emergency, it is important to make an immediate decision, as soon

  text: An aircraft is flying at an altitude of 2 000 feet, the aircraft must intercept
    the glide slope from above for an automatic ILS approach. The SPEED autothrottle
    mode is selected on the Mode Control Panel. Just before the descent the left (number
    1) radio altimeter reading drops to -8 ft, which automatically causes the autothrottle
    to close (RETARD). The right (number 2) radio altimeter reads 2000 ft. The pilots
    see the change in the autothrottle setting but, as the number 2 radio altimeter
    is still operating, they assume that it still controls the autothrottle and that
    the RETARD mode is normal for the descent. They do NOT adjust the settings on
    the Mode Control Panel. On intercepting the glide slope, the pilots assume the
    autothrottle will automatically enter the SPEED mode, and do NOT detect that the
    throttles actually remain closed until the loss of airspeed becomes critical.
    What does this scenario indicate about the pilots' assessment of the situation?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - This scenario illustrates how complacency can jeopardise safety; although the
    workload level is high, the pilots' incorrect inputs to the Mode Control Panel
    place the aircraft in a hazardous situation.
  - The pilots commit a manual handling error by failing to check the reason for the
    autothrottle RETARD and they also commit a lapse by failing to notice that the
    autothrottle remains closed.
  - The pilots have good mode awareness but they commit manual handling errors and
    lapses by failing to follow Standard Operating Procedures and failing to carry
    out checks.
  - The pilots have mode confusion and an incorrect mental model created by the cognitive
    illusion that the autothrottle is operating normally.

  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - The pilot of a light aircraft, preparing for an afternoon flight with a full load
    of passengers and baggage, notices that the air temperature has increased more
    than expected. The pilot decides to recalculate the take-off performance. The
    calculation shows that the aircraft performance is insufficient for the current
    air temperature, and the pilot delays the flight until later in the day.
  - A pilot plans several stops en-route to the final destination. At the first stop,
    the pilot calculates that the fuel remaining is sufficient to reach the destination
    without refuelling. However, during the second leg of the flight, the headwind
    increases. The pilot decides that there should be just enough fuel to complete
    the flight as planned. The aircraft does reach the final destination but has to
    use some of the planned alternative fuel, which should normally only be used in
    case of diversion.
  - A light aircraft on a VFR cross-country flight is approaching higher terrain when
    the pilot notices that the cloud base over the hills is lower than expected, and
    will be below VMC limits if the flight is continued as planned. The pilot wishes
    to remain in VMC and has insufficient fuel to re-route to avoid the high ground.
    The pilot therefore turns back.
  - During a pre-flight check of a twin-engine aircraft, the pilot notices a small
    snitch of … The pilot does NOT consider this significant, and decides to continue
    the flight as planned.

    and will veto a vote for the riskier option.
  - The fact that three people can discuss every available option will probably lead
    to the best possible decision being made; however, the time required to make the
    decision will increase considerably.
  - People acting and deciding as a group are more likely to make riskier decisions
    than every individual belonging to the group would have made on his/her own.
  - There will be no group effects on decision making; in aviation, every decision
    is ultimately made by the commander alone.

  text: A Training Captain who teaches other pilots how to deal with emergencies is
    more likely to be able to deal with a real emergency than one of the pilots who
    only practises emergencies during recurrent training. Which of the following correctly
    describes the relationship between skills and long term memory?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - Long term memory is limited, and will become overwritten with newer skills.
  - Long term memory is practically unlimited. Skills are stored in the long term
    memory, but after not using the skills for a long time, retraining may be needed
    to access the skills.
  - The long term memory cannot store skills for more than 6 months, so that is the
    period at which recurrent training is required.
  - Skills are not held in the long term memory, instead they have a separate storage
    level in the brain which is unlimited and does not ever need to be revisited.

  options:
  - Is a result of boredom, and is associated with a low cognitive workload; it is

  - Can be the consequence of a low cognitive workload, where attention becomes focused

  - Is likely to occur during the cruise as effective monitoring has a high cognitive

  - Is likely to result in automation complacency, because monitoring is a low cognitive

  text: 'Automation (autoflight) is aimed to aid and protect the flight of aircraft.
    Select the correct statement:'
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - In a fly-by-wire aircraft, computer-controlled flight modes are used to control
    surface movements and prevent the aircraft from exceeding operational limits;
    in such aircraft, the pilot has full control authority and therefore is the last
    operator.
  - Automation is more reliable than humans but the crew are more capable than the
    automation of making decisions and performing in unexpected situations and emergencies.
    Therefore, central to all automation concepts is that the pilot is the last operator.
  - Primary flight computers can fully control an aircraft, aiding the crew in preventing
    the aircraft from exceeding limitations, and to fly efficiently. One automation
    concept has the pilot as the last operator while another allows the automation
    to correct pilot error.
  - Automation can reduce crew workload and protect from exceeding aircraft limitations,
    especially in an emergency or unexpected condition. For this reason automation
    concepts always ensure that the flight computers have ultimate control authority,
    to correct for pilot error.

  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - If the pilot has a stable personality, the failures during training would lead
    to low self-esteem, and are likely to result in the pilot adopting behaviour which
    displays complacency, overconfidence, and intolerance of the mistakes made by
    others.
  - If the pilot has a stable personality and a positive attitude, he/she is likely
    to adopt the same mature approach as the instructor to overcome difficulties,
    and accept that others can sometimes make errors but still be competent pilots.
  - Regardless of the pilot's personality or attitude, the difficulties experienced
    in the training environment are likely to be dominant, and result in the pilot
    having low self-esteem, low confidence and to be compliant in his/her response
    to others.
  - The pilot completed the course, so the difficulties that occurred during the training

  text: The pilot of a multi-engined aircraft has quite a high workload, looking out
    for traffic and also concentrating on following ATC instructions to avoid a potential
    traffic conflict. After a very brief look at the instruments, the pilot's eyes
    automatically focus on the analogue engine gauges. He/she quickly sees that one
    needle indicates an abnormally high oil pressure value for the left engine. What
    statement correctly explains how the brain is storing and processing the information
    from the instruments in the above scenario?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - The visual image of the abnormal value is stored in the sensory store for about
    1 second. The pilot automatically reacts to the abnormality by looking at the
    gauges, and then his/her attention consciously focuses on their indications.
  - The attention of the pilot is split between focussing inside the cockpit and looking
    outside. The indications from the instruments are stored for up to 20 seconds
    in the visual sensory store, enabling the pilot to process their information whilst
    following the ATC instructions.
  - The indications from all the instruments are stored as information in the pilot's
    working memory. The pilot then consciously and quickly processes the information
    and decides that one engine's oil pressure value is abnormal.
  - The pilot detects the abnormal value by making a detailed scan of all the instruments,
    complying with the procedures requiring continuous cross-checking of instruments
    during flight. His/her selective attention is focussed on all the instruments'
    values.

    actually reading the instrument indications.
  - Just before the approach for landing at the destination in the late afternoon,

  options:
  - The Commander has made a good assessment of the situation but takes too much time
    to reach a decision. As a result, the risk of ice contamination increases, along
    with a reduction in aircraft performance.
  - The decision to depart is good, but the Commander fails to review the decision
    once they have taken-off by ignoring the influence of ice contamination on aircraft
    performance.
  - The Commander fails to properly evaluate his/her options before take-off by underestimating
    the risk of ice formation during flight and/or ignoring the influence of ice contamination
    on aircraft performance.
  - The Commander properly assesses the situation and evaluates the options correctly,

    changing the missed approach procedure. What is correct regarding the pilots''
    attention and the risks associated with the above situation? '
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - The attention of the Pilot Not Flying could be diverted from the task of monitoring
    the aircraft parameters, which can lead to a loss of awareness of the aircraft's
    state.
  - Listening to the ATC instruction could divert the Pilot Flying's attention from
    the task of controlling the aircraft. The Pilot Flying should be able to carry
    out both tasks successfully, because a go-around is a routine procedure.
  - The Pilot Not Flying (PNF) copies and acknowledges the ATC instructions, while
    the Pilot Flying (PF) takes over the PNF's monitoring duties. Because of the additional
    tasks performed, the PF can suffer from cognitive overload.
  - The ATC communication will probably be ignored, because the attention of the Pilot
    Not Flying is fully concentrated on monitoring the aircraft's parameters and checking
    the go-around procedures, while the Pilot Flying is fully engaged in controlling
    the aircraft.

    \ path.   \n  \n In order to maintain the maximum awareness of their flight status,\
    \ what is the best action for the pilots to take?"
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - Re-programming of the FMS in the LNAV VNAV mode during periods of high workload
    can lead to errors and also cause a loss of situational awareness. Therefore,
    the pilots should downgrade to a lower, simpler level of automation such as ALT/HDG
    or even to manual flying.
  - The FMS in LNAV VNAV mode is the primary, and most accurate, navigation system
    available to the pilots, and its use should be maintained. In order to minimise
    data entry errors, both pilots should check the entry of the new LNAV/VNAV parameters
    at the same time.
  - In order to mitigate against loss of situational awareness, and avoid the risk
    of errors while entering new data, the FMS should be switched off, and the pilots
    should respond to ATC instructions by flying the aircraft manually.
  - The main risk is that the pilots become distracted while re-programming the FMS.
    To reduce this risk, the Pilot-in- Command should immediately request a short
    delay or a hold, in order to complete the entry of the new LNAV VNAV parameters,
    before continuing with the approach.

  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - During periods of high workload, greater use of text messages (for example through
    the Flight Management System) is required in order to communicate effectively.
  - A high workload increases the amount of time available for listening.
  - People with high workloads are able to deal better with sudden emergencies because
    they are able to allocate their time more successfully. This makes communication
    much easier.
  - Side-by-side flight-deck seating makes it very difficult for flight crew members
    to notice each other's body language or actions in periods of high workload.

    the end of his/her contract, he/she learns that only one out of two co-pilots
    will be offered a subsequent contract for continuation of their employment. The
    copilot shows a high motivation. What should a commander flying with this copilot
    pay particular attention to?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - It can be assumed that the copilot is under pressure to perform, because he feels
    that any mistake could cause his employer to give the vacant spot to his competitor
    at the end of the contract. The commander should aim to remove some of the pressure
    by reassuring the copilot that his work is highly appreciated.
  - The commander should be aware that the copilot will probably feel a lower desire
    to perform, because the end of his contract is approaching and he may not be working
    for the company for very long. The commander should remind the copilot that any
    deterioration in performance will not be tolerated.
  - It is the commander’s responsibility to assist his employer in deciding on the
    better copilot for continuation of the contract. He should therefore closely monitor
    the copilot’s work and report any errors or insecurities to his superior without
    the copilot noticing.
  - The commander should tell the copilot that he is aware of his possibly increased
    basic stress level and demand clearly that the copilot keep all his personal emotions
    out of the cockpit.

    with the weather ahead of them, the crew fails to notice that they have accidentally
    pulled back the thrust levers too far, disabling the autothrottle. As airspeed
    drops, and aerodynamic buffet sets in, it is interpreted by the crew as entry
