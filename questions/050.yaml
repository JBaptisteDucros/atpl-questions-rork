  text: Which of the following statements is correct about a warm occlusion in Western
    Europe?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - In a warm occlusion, the cool polar continental air mass undercuts the colder
    arctic maritime air mass. The rain band just ahead of the surface position of
    the front has embedded CBs, severe turbulence, and hail. A thick frontal fog follows
    the surface position of the front.
  - In a warm occlusion, the warm, moist tropical maritime air overrides the cold
    polar maritime air ahead. Precipitation and radiation fog occur ahead of the surface
    position of the front.
  - A warm occlusion is a combination of a warm and cold front. At the surface, it
    resembles a warm front with embedded CBs. The precipitation falls ahead of the
    surface position of the front.
  - A warm occlusion is a combination of a warm and a cold front. At the surface,
    it resembles a cold front with embedded CBs and heavy rain, which are located
    close to just behind the surface position of the front.

  text: What seasonal variations in weather conditions can be observed during warm
    fronts in Northern Europe across different seasons?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - In summer, the warm fronts are in most cases accompanied with heavy showers of
    rain and severe thunderstorms, produced by embedded Ns clouds.
  - In winter, the temperature difference between the two air masses is smaller than
    in the summer, and therefore the average upper winds are weaker than in the summer.
  - In winter, the warm front is often accompanied by dense fog, a low cloud ceiling,
    and freezing drizzle at the surface. In summer, the warm front can sometimes produce
    heavy thunderstorms.
  - In summer, the warm front is often accompanied by freezing rain or freezing drizzle
    close to the surface. In winter, the icing conditions close to the surface are
    less severe than in the summer, due to the lower moisture content of the air.

  text: Mark the statement most reasonable regarding a valley inversion.
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - Over night, cool dense air as a result of radiation cooling will descend along
    the mountain slopes into the basin and lead to the development of a valley inversion.
  - If the incident solar radiation is non-uniform because of orographic conditions,
    the development of a valley inversion is very likely during daytime.
  - Provided that the lee side winds are able to displace the air at the bottom of
    the basin, the Foehn effect is the predominant factor in the development of a
    valley inversion.
  - Small scale density variations due to turbulent mixing (mainly caused by the roughness
    of rocks) are a significant prerequisite for the formation of valley inversions.

  text: 'Choose the correct statement regarding the transfer of heat in the atmosphere:'
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - The air at the surface can be cooled or warmed by the process of conduction, which
    is the molecular transfer of heat between the surface and the air in contact with
    it.
  - The conduction of heat between the surface and the air in contact with it creates
    turbulent mixing, which is the most significant component in the transfer of heat
    to or from medium levels in the Earth's atmosphere.
  - Turbulent mixing contributes mainly to the transfer of heat in the Earth's atmosphere,
    in the horizontal plane, but has little effect in the warming or cooling of the
    atmosphere in the vertical plane.
  - The primary process involved in the transfer of heat upwards from the surface
    of the Earth into the upper atmosphere is turbulence, which exists throughout
    the Earth's atmosphere.

  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - In order for heat transfer to take place between the surface and the lower atmosphere,
    both conduction and turbulence are necessary.
  - The process of conduction is the primary mechanism by which heat is transferred
    from the surface vertically within the atmosphere to low or medium levels.
  - In the mixing layer, eddy currents within the turbulence transfer heat from the
    surface upwards and, if they persist throughout the layer, the surface temperature
    gradually decreases.
  - The molecular transfer of heat to or from the surface into the atmosphere takes
    place by conduction regardless of any temperature difference between the surface
    and the air in contact with it.

  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - Cold air is advected from a cold high coastal plain dropping down onto a warm
    sea surface causing well-developed convection clouds and severe icing.
  - A low pressure system moves over a cold surface causing icing that extends into
    at least the mid-levels.
  - Cold air becomes trapped, creating an area of low pressure aloft, which causes
    instability.
  - Warm air is advected by the upper airflow, which causes a cold low-level jetstream

  text: Which one of the following statements correctly describes how a cold-air drop
    is formed?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - A cold-air drop is formed when a large low-pressure centre is created above the
    surface descent of very cold air within a warm anticyclone.
  - A large mass of polar air moves to a lower latitude and becomes surrounded by
    warmer air. This creates a low-pressure centre above the surface, known as cold-air
    drop.
  - Air behind a slow-moving warm front passes over a cold surface. In this case the
    cooling of the air above can result in a localised pool of cold air forming, and
    a corresponding fall in pressure. This is known as a cold-air drop.
  - In summer, the air behind a cold front can slow down as the primary system becomes
    weaker. In this case surface heating results in a fall in pressure, which creates
    a small area of lower pressure known as a cold-air drop.

  text: What weather conditions are associated with the summer monsoon on the Indian
    sub-continent?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - Mainly dry and clear weather as the airflow travels over a continental land mass.
  - Significant stability as a result of the decreasing Environmental Lapse Rate (ELR).
  - Convective weather caused by the flow of air from the continental land mass to
    the sea, which cools and condenses the low layers of the air mass.
  - Strong convective activity created by the moist onshore airflow that heats up
    from below as it encounters the warmer continental land mass.

  text: Which of the following best describes a Monsoon?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - The winter monsoon is an offshore wind created by a continental low pressure,
    the summer monsoon is onshore and created by a continental high pressure.
  - During the summer, the warm ocean causes large-scale, low-level winds to blow
    from the landmass to the sea, but in winter, the cooler ocean causes these winds
    to blow from the sea to the land mass.
  - During the summer, the large-scale, low-level wind predominantly blows from the
    ocean towards the continent, but during the winter, it blows from the continent
    towards the ocean.
  - The summer monsoon is predominantly warm and dry blowing towards the sea, the
    winter monsoon is predominantly cool and moist, and blows towards the land.

  - The risk of encountering airframe icing is the same over all areas, due to the

  - Over the sea, as air masses tends to be more humid there than elsewhere leading
    to more intense airframe icing.
  - Over mountain range, as this causes upward air motion on the windward side, forcing
    large supercooled water droplets to rise above the freezing level.

  - can be relatively easily recognised as the rotor manifests itself in the form

  - may be strong but as it is very localised it is sufficient if the pilot holds
    firmly onto the controls for a few seconds to prevent any sudden upset of the

  text: What is correct about forecasts of en-route turbulence?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - The forecasts of en-route turbulence issued by the Meteorological Watch Office
    for the FIR are NOT considered reliable because they depend on pilots making accurate
    and timely in-flight reports of turbulence, and in practice these reports are
    subjective and often NOT relevant to other aircraft.
  - The most recent forecasts of en-route turbulence on significant weather charts
    are considered to be both reliable and accurate because they are modified automatically
    by pilot in-flight reports relayed via data link to the relevant Meteorological
    Watch Office for the applicable FIR.
  - The accurate forecasting of the severity, extent, and levels affected by turbulence
    is based on modelling; because forecast documentation also covers a fixed time
    period it is often NOT reliable, so pilot reports of turbulence are of great value.
  - The turbulence forecasts on significant weather charts are based on modern and
    comprehensive computer modelling techniques using all available data, and they
    are considered to be both accurate and reliable, making pilot reports redundant.

  text: Which of these statements is correct regarding the difference between atmospheric
    turbulence and wind shear.
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - Wind shear and atmospheric turbulence are the same thing and both result from
    sustained changes in the wind direction and/or speed, however, when the changes
    are frequent enough to displace an aircraft from its intended flight path they
    are described as wind shear.
  - The short-duration gustiness caused by fluctuations in the normal wind flow is
    the main cause of wind shear; however, where the gustiness is sustained over longer
    periods it is described as atmospheric turbulence, and can occur at all levels
    in the atmosphere.
  - Atmospheric turbulence is the result of short duration and irregular movements
    of air from the undisturbed wind flow, whereas wind shear is caused by sudden
    and sustained changes in the wind direction and/or speed within a short distance.
  - Irregular short-period oscillations in the wind flow are the main cause of atmospheric
    turbulence, and when the turbulence is strong enough to cause fluctuations in
    aircraft airspeed, and/or attitude, it is described as wind shear.

  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - The set of possible effects of a lightning discharge does not include welding
    of aircraft parts such as joints or bearings.
  - Because an aircraft acts as a “”Faraday\`s cage””, the magnetisation associated
    with a lightning discharge hardly has an effect on the magnetic compass.
  - While flying through air that is electrically charged the aircraft is likely to
    become a charge carrier itself and can initiate a lightning discharge.
  - The probability of a lightning discharge is reciprocally proportional to the strength
    of the electric field the aircraft intruded.

  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - Aircraft made by composite material may get severe damage, the crew may be blinded
    and temporarily lose the hearing.
  - Though flying through an electric field, the aircraft itself is not a charge carrier
    and therefore it cannot initiate a lightning discharge.
  - An aircraft made by metal has a certain capacity to attract a lightning, but the
    lightning will follow the surface and therefore no damage will be caused.
  - An aircraft has in the atmosphere the same qualities as a "Faraday's cage", which
    means that struck of lightning seldom occurs. But if it happens, the result will
    be an occasional engine failure. The crew may get a shock.

  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - Aircraft are “Faraday\`s cages” and lightning has no effect on the structure of
    the aircraft. However the thunder may frighten some passengers.
  - Most aircraft are considered to be “Faraday\`s cages” and the impact of lightning
    strikes is minor, but in some cases structural damages may occur. The bright flash
    may also blind the pilot for 30 seconds or more.
  - Water on the fuselage weakens the effect of the “Faraday\`s cage” and may allow
    lightning to penetrate the aircrafts skin and to injure passengers.
  - The consequences of lightning strikes on aircraft in flight are not predictable.
    In many cases it results in accidents, sometimes with the total loss of the aircraft.

  text: Due to a wind-shear event during an approach to land, the headwind component
    suddenly increases just before the flare. If the pilot does NOT take appropriate
    action, this could lead to..
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - the development of a loss-of-energy situation, requiring a swift increase in engine
    power.
  - the aircraft "ballooning" and landing beyond the touch&down aiming point, increasing
    the possibility of a runway excursion.
  - the aircraft descending and its trajectory going below the intended descent profile.
  - a sudden drop in indicated airspeed and associated "ballooning" during the flare,
    leading to a heavy landing short of the touch&down aiming point.

  text: During the approach, a wind shear that is less than 20 kt is reported. The
    pilot needs to land at its destination. What decision should the pilot make?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - Land on the runway in use since it has been chosen to be the less affected by
    the wind shear.
  - Delay the approach as the wind shear, even small, is a big threat for the landing
    at this airport.
  - Request the opposite runway as the wind shear will have fewer effects.
  - Land on the initially intended runway as the aircraft is specifically designed
    to withstand such wind shears.

  text: Which of the following statements regarding the development of valley inversions
    is correct?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - The most important prerequisite for the development of valley inversions is warm
    air ascending along the mountain slope, thus leaving cooler air behind in the
    bottom of the valley.
  - The predominant factor in the development process of valley inversions is the
    non-uniformity of incident solar radiation due to orographic conditions in combination
    with density variations within the air.
  - Valley inversions often are a result of radiation cooling in combination with
    gravity, both affecting the air at the surface of a mountain slope.
  - Usually a valley inversion is initiated by radiation cooling and anabatic winds
    which are due to orographic conditions.

    within mountainous area under the influence of a blocking anticyclone in winter.
    Mark the most reasonable statement given below.
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - While approaching the airfield in the early morning hours, these conditions apply
    for the possibility of a marked valley inversion which has to be considered as
    a potential flight hazard due to a decreased lift after breaking through the inversion
    layer.
  - While approaching the airfield shortly before sunrise, the pilot has to consider
    turbulence because at first lift will be decreased due to katabatic winds and,
    after breaking through a valley inversion layer, lift is likely to improve due
    to anabatic winds.
  - While approaching the airfield in the early morning, after a short period of bumpiness
    the engines of the aircraft will deliver more thrust after breaking through the
    inversion layer if the pilot does not intervene.
  - While approaching the airfield in the late evening hours, without the pilot\`s
    intervention the engines of the aircraft are most likely to provide less thrust
    after breaking through the inversion layer.

    altitude set at 12 000 ft, while observing lenticular clouds above the mountain
    range?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - Lense shaped clouds (Ac Lenticularis) indicate mountain waves at high levels,
    and rotor zones at lower levels, so safest procedure would be to avoid the area
    and re-route around it.
  - Lense shaped clouds (Ac Lenticularis) indicate turbulent air overhead and downwind
    from the mountain range; the flight should be proceeded at minimum safe altitude.
  - Lense shaped clouds (Ac Lenticularis) indicate smooth air overhead and downwind
    from the mountain range; flight should be proceeded as planned while maintaining
    obstacle clearance.
  - Lense shaped clouds (Ac Lenticularis) indicate strong vertical currents with tendency
    to development of CB clouds; the safest procedure is to increase obstacle clearance
    before proceeding as planned.

  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - The inflow of air into the base of a CB or TS at night can result, occasionally,
    in the concentration of the wind near the cold surface, which leads to the formation
    of a low-level jet stream.
  - When warm air in the evening moves into the friction layer near the surface, a
    low-level jet stream can sometimes form, within or above the top of the layer.
  - An inflow of cold air over land or strong radiation cooling in the evening can
    lead to an inversion; at or just below the top of the inversion a low-level jet
    stream can form.
  - When the airflow near the surface is forced against a mass of cold air ahead of
    a warm front at night, the low-level wind increases and can occasionally form
    a low-level jet stream.

  text: Which of the following statements correctly describes the theoretical development
    of the geostrophic wind within the Northern Hemisphere?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - An air parcel initially at rest will move from high pressure to low pressure because
    of the coriolis force, but as the air moves it is deflected to the right and is
    eventually balanced by the pressure gradient force.
  - As a surface pressure difference begins, air will start to move towards the lower
    pressure. As the wind gains speed, the pressure gradient force deflection increases
    to the right until it equals the coriolis force and the wind now blows perpendicular
    to the isobars.
  - The pressure gradient force moves the air towards the low pressure, but surface
    friction starts to pull the air anticlockwise, eventually causing the wind to
    blow parallel to the isobars with the low pressure positioned downstream to the
    left.
  - As the air starts to move and is accelerated by the pressure gradient force, it
    is increasingly deflected to the right by the coriolis force until both forces
    are balanced and opposite to each other.

  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - In a mountain-wave system at medium to high level the smooth outline of any associated
    cloud indicates that turbulence and strong vertical currents are NOT likely to
    be present.
  - Mountain waves tend to occur at low level, where the wave motion is severely weakened
    by the terrain and therefore the wave flow is NOT likely to be a hazard to aircraft.
  - The airflow in a mountain-wave system is often smooth but vertical currents can
    be strong enough to exceed the performance capability of an aircraft.

  text: Which is correct regarding the propagation of mountain wave effects from low
    to high level?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - A strong westerly airflow that increases in speed with height, when combined with
    a deep, unstable layer in the vicinity of a mountain range, can often result in
    the wave motion, and its associated turbulence, extending from low through to
    high level.
  - The presence of a jet stream passing over a mountain range tends to reinforce
    a mountain wave system that has developed at lower levels. This reinforcement
    provides the optimum conditions for the mountain waves to extend up to the level
    of the jet stream.
  - When winds from a consistent direction, approximately perpendicular to a mountain
    range or high plateau, increase in speed with height within a deep, stable layer,
    mountain waves and their effects can extend from low to high level.
  - A deep, stable layer combined with a consistent, strong, westerly flow at low
    level over a mountain range can result in a mountain wave system developing up
    to high level, when the decrease in air density with height is matched by a similar
    decrease in wind speed with height.

  text: Name the most important conditions for the formation of significant lee waves
    within a mountain range.
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - A strong large-scale wind increase up to high levels and blowing approximately
    perpendicular towards the mountain range under a stable thermal stratification.
  - Lee waves form when strong winds blow parallel to the mountain range and split
    up into two branches. The wind shear across the crest causes lee waves.
  - A strong heating of the air on the windward side, contrasting with strong cooling
    on the leeward side of the mountain range.
  - Warm moist air arrives under an unstable thermal stratification on the windward
    side. Lee waves develop in the unstable stratification on the leeward side.

  - wind direction parallel to the mountain range – wind speed increasing with height
    – extensive isothermal layer between mountain crests and the tropopause.
  - wind direction approximately at right angles to the mountain range – wind speed
    30 kt and steadily increasing with height – an inversion just above the crest
    level with less stable air above and below.
  - wind speed less than 15 kt and wind direction at right angles to mountains – intense
    radiation cooling at night, particularly at the higher levels.
  - wind direction parallel to the general alignment of the mountain range – wind
    speed increasing with height – intense surface heating.

    within the troposphere?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - If the updrafts are strong enough, they can break through the inversion, thus
    producing a noctilucent cloud.
  - The inversion will stop any further convection and the released energy will lead
    to severe hail storms.
  - A cloud, reaching the inversion, may stop its ascent and the upper winds may produce
    an anvil shape.
  - If the inversion is at a very low altitude, the blocking of the updraft will lead
    to the formation of a supercell thunderstorm.

  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - The ground inversion inhibits vertical movement of air causing the formation of
    fog in the cold air just above the inversion layer.
  - The inversion contributes to the release of latent heat, which in turn breaks
    down the ground inversion causing instability.
  - In the ground inversion, the air closest to the ground is coldest due to radiation,
    and it is stable.
  - The dew point is reached in the inversion layer due to the decrease of temperature

  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - When the Earth radiates heat at night into the air above it, warming it above
    its dew point and so condensing its water vapour into fog droplets.
  - When the Sun's radiation warms the air in contact with the Earth's surface above
    its dew point and the evaporated water droplets are supported by wind blowing
    up a slope.
  - When the Earth radiates heat into space; air in contact with Earth's surface is
    cooled below its dew point and the condensed droplets are supported by mechanical
    turbulence.
  - When the Sun's radiation evaporates water from wet ground. The saturated air is
    cooled below its dew point as it flows over cold ground in winter, and the condensed
    droplets are supported by the wind.

    of a front, more commonly over hills than over low ground. It may also develop
    when...'
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - dust particles blown by strong winds at a cold front become condensation nuclei
    for water droplets.
  - the air becomes saturated by continuous rain falling from warm air above a frontal
    surface.
  - cold air crossing warm, damp ground absorbs water vapour, which then recondenses
    in the cold air.
  - a cold front cools the warm air it displaces, at the surface, to below its dew
    point.

    the fog?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - When the surface is heated in the cloudless sky immediately after the warm front
    has passed.
  - The wind backs as the front passes, the air becomes drier and fog particles re-absorb
    into water vapour.
  - The descending air in the warm sector causes fog droplets to fall on the surface
    as dew, the visibility should improve.
  - After the front has passed there is no more cold air to cool the humid air close
    to the surface, the visibility should improve.

  text: In what way can the air temperature affect the dew point temperature?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - When the air temperature rises, the air can hold more water vapour at the same
    pressure and therefore the dew point also rises.
  - Changes in the air temperature can alter the relative humidity in the free atmosphere,
    but have NO effect on the dew point.
  - The dew point temperature varies inversely with changes in the air temperature.
  - When the air temperature falls below the dew point at a constant pressure in the
    atmosphere, the dew point also reduces.

  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - Gridded forecasts offer NO specific advantages to pilots because a traditional
    forecast such as a TAF offers the same information.
  - These forecasts are constantly updated in real-time, and these updates may be
    provided to crews if their aircraft is suitably equipped to receive them.
  - Gridded forecasts can be merged in information processing systems with data from
    aircraft reports to provide improved situational awareness.
  - Gridded forecasts use less memory in a Flight Management System, allowing more
    rapid refreshing of the Primary Flight Display.

  text: For a high level commercial air transport flight across the North Atlantic,
    the weather forecast indicated cloud and occasional moderate turbulence below

    a SIGMET broadcast indicating that a small area of moderate to severe clear air
    turbulence exists in a location close to the planned route. This information about
    the previously unexpected turbulence provides the flight crew with valuable advance
    warning, allowing them to make an early change to their track. What is the most
    likely basis of this SIGMET?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - The Meteorological Watch Office revised their computer modelling, which indicated
    a small area of significant turbulence that had not been evident before.
  - The significant area of turbulence was very likely to have been detected by a
    weather satellite.
  - The turbulence reported in the SIGMET, issued by the Meteorological Watch Office,
    is most likely to have been based on pilot reports.
  - An area of significant clear air turbulence was detected by long range ground-based
    radar and when this information was relayed to the appropriate Meteorological
