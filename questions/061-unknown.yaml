  options:
  - The magnetic variation changes over time due to the movement of magnetised material
    inside the Earth.
  - The magnetic field reduces in intensity each year due to the half-life of the
    magnetised material inside the Earth.
  - The intensity of the Earth's magnetic field decreases over time due to rotation

  text: What is the primary advantage of using line features during a VFR flight?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - Line features can be followed towards a significant position.
  - Following line features, particularly if they are distinctive, removes the need
    for dead reckoning navigation.
  - Line features should normally be free of the other VFR navigation traffic.
  - Overflying an area containing several railway lines and roads, the correct line
    features can still be reliably identified.

  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - Due to the specific wavelength to the colour red, lit obstacles are difficult
    to identify, increasing the potential for a collision.
  - During an outside scan using peripheral vision, illuminated obstacles appear as
    being further away than they actually are, giving the impression that there is
    adequate avoidance time.
  - If the aircraft deviates from the planned route, natural obstacles excluded during
    the planning stage could be a threat as they could be difficult to see.
  - Location of aerodromes CANNOT be easily identified unless flying overhead, due
    to low lightning intensity.

  text: What statement is correct as regards the properties of a Great Circle?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - The intersection point of a great circle and the Equator are named "the vertices",
    which are positioned 180° apart in longitude.
  - Both vertices of a great circle are positioned at the same latitude and 180° apart
    in longitude on the same hemisphere.
  - The latitudes of both vertices are of different values, the longitudes are equal
    although respectively East and West.
  - Both vertices of a great circle are situated at the same distance respectively
    North and South of the Equator and 180° apart in longitude.

  text: An aircraft flies on the Northern Hemisphere following an easterly direction
    to a destination aerodrome with a higher latitude than the departure aerodrome.
    A straight line is plotted between the departure and destination aerodrome to
    determine the shortest ground distance and the desired track. Which of the following
    statements is correct regarding this flight?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - Convergency decreases with increasing latitude.
  - As great circle tracks are plotted as straight lines, they do NOT have a changing
    track direction.
  - Due to the increase in latitude, the final track angle at the destination will
    be higher than at the departure.
  - Due to Earth convergency, the track direction will continuously increase during
    the flight.
