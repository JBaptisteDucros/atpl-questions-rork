    position close to the runway accompanied by a sign indicating "SI". The reason
    of separate holding positions for CAT II and III operations is...
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - Because of the lower visibility observed during CAT II and III operations, the
    landing pilot(s) may mistake the lights from the waiting aircraft as runway lighting,
    causing a distraction during the landing.
  - The landing minima for CAT II and Ill operations are lower and therefore require
    greater precision, and an aircraft waiting too close to the landing runway may
    affect the quality of the ILS signals.
  - Aircraft must be kept further away from the runway during CAT II and Ill operations
    as arriving aeroplanes may land automatically and therefore require more space.
  - Since aeroplanes perform an autoland during CAT I operations, the autopilot is
    able to fly the aeroplane more accurately and therefore the CAT I position may
    be closer to the runway.

    changing randomly and both the localiser and glide path showing warning flags
    intermittently. What is the most likely reason for this?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - The ILS shows incorrect indications unless the aircraft is established on inbound
    course and on the glideslope, so such indications are normal during radar vectoring.
  - Reflections from objects within the ILS coverage area leading to multipath signals
    outside the coverage area.
  - Lack of reception of the modulation signals due to a failure of the ground transmitters,
    so the aircraft receiver fails to lock onto the incoming signals.
  - The aircraft is heading in the opposite direction to the localiser thus the indications
    are reversed and change frequently.

  text: Navigating to an NDB at dusk, you notice the ADF needle swinging erratically.
    What could be the reason?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - The ionospheric reflections travel shorter distances than the ground signal, which
    causes fading of the signal when they interfere.
  - Sky waves are amplified by the ionosphere, which causes the ADF needle to alternate
    between the sky wave and the ground wave.
  - Interference between the ground wave and sky wave, which causes fading when the
    signals arrive at the receiver in phase.
  - Interference occurs between the ground wave and sky wave causing the signal to
    fade when the two waves are out of phases.

  text: As an aeroplane is approaching the runway while taxiing for departure, the
    flight crew observes two sets of yellow lines drawn across the taxiway. One line
    further away from the runway has a sign stating "S2 CAT II/III," and the line
    closer to the runway has a sign stating "SI". Why is there a separate holding
    position for category II and Ill operations when compared to all other operations,
    including CAT l?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - Aircraft must be kept further away from the runway during CAT II and Ill operations
    as arriving aeroplanes may land automatically and therefore require more space.
  - Since aeroplanes perform an autoland during CAT I operations, the autopilot is
    able to fly the aeroplane more accurately and therefore the CAT I position may
    be closer to the runway.
  - The landing minima for CAT II and Ill operations are lower and therefore require
    greater precision, and an aircraft waiting too close to the landing runway may
    affect the quality of the ILS signals.
  - Because of the lower visibility observed during CAT II and III operations, the
    landing pilot(s) may mistake the lights from the waiting aircraft as runway lighting,
    causing a distraction during the landing.

  text: A DME ground station can generally respond to a maximum of 100 aircraft at
    once. What is the reason for this limitation?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - Limitation of transmission by the echo protection circuit, which avoids replies
    being reflected and coming back into the DME ground station.
  - Saturation of the DME receivers in the aircraft, receiving all interrogations
    of other aircraft in the vicinity that are on the same frequency.
  - The difference in strengths of the received signals CANNOT be differentiated by
    the DME ground station, and consequently the weakest signals fall off.
  - Saturation of the DME ground station working on only one receive frequency and
    one transmit frequency.

  text: Which statement about the Special Position Identification (SPI) pulse is correct?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - This pulse is transmitted by the SSR-interrogator in order to request for identification
    of a certain aircraft.
  - This pulse is transmitted automatically every time the transponder responds to
    a mode A interrogation.
  - This pulse is transmitted by the transponder as a result of the pilot pushing
    the IDENT-button.
  - This pulse is transmitted by the SSR-interrogator if it is suspected that responses
    are received from aircraft which are located in the direction of the side lobes
    of the interrogator antenna.

  options:
  - The higher tilt setting will narrow the beam width, allowing for effective detection
    of cumulonimbus clouds at shorter range.
  - If the beam’s tilt remains at the setting used during cruise, the scanning range
    will be reduced and significant ground clutter may be displayed.
  - If the beam’s tilt remains at the setting used during cruise, the scanning range
    will be reduced and the strength of the reflected signals will be weaker.

    of the continent use the same EGNOS system but for each runway there is a given
    5-digit channel number. Which of the following statements is correct?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - Any GNSS receivers are by default capable of using the EGNOS signals since they
    use the same frequency as GPS whereas additional equipment is needed to receive
    GBAS.
  - EGNOS covers an extensive area by using geostationary satellites and the channel
    number is used for approach identification only since EGNOS uses the normal GPS
    frequency.
  - EGNOS is the European SBAS that is used to improve accuracy and integrity of general
    GNSS navigation and GBAS is used to augment SBAS when selecting its channel number.
  - EGNOS is the European satellite system running in parallel with GPS but has more
    satellites, enabling greater accuracy, and the channel number is to tune the receiver

  text: Within the Performance Based Navigation concept, RNP requires on-board performance
    monitoring and alerting. An advanced navigation system such as a Flight Management
    System (FMS) will assess its own position and calculate an Estimated Position
    Error (EPE). How can this be achieved?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - The Inertial Reference System (IRS) provides the ultimate reference for the aircraft's
    position; the position determined by radio navigation will be a measure of the
    error of the FMS position.
  - Aircraft with a single FMS will compare the FM position with the IRS position
    and will use the difference, if any, to calculate a bias that is applied to the
    FMS position to improve its accuracy.
  - The FMS will use several sources of navigation information and, depending on their
    expected accuracy, create a comparison between these position data and the FMS
    position.
  - This process requires at least two independent FMSs in order for them to compare
    each other’s position, thereby calculating a correction to be applied to the FMS
    positions.

  text: An RNP APCH to LNAV/VNAV minima based on BARO-VNAV can only be conducted when
    the aircraft is within a promulgated temperature range. What is the reason for
    this?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - Static vents can be blocked due to icing when approaching in IMC, hence leading
    to a loss of vertical guidance.
  - The calculated true air speed (TAS) is based on the standard atmosphere and any
    significant differences will lead to an approach speed which could be too slow
    or too fast.
  - The difference between true height and published decision height has to be limited
    to a maximum value.
  - The assessment of the vertical position of the aircraft, in relation to the glide
    path angle (GPA) during the approach is based on barometric data.

    flying a radius to fix (RF) leg? The flight director…
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - provides guidance based on a fixed radius calculated with current TAS and bank
    angle.
  - must be used in place of the autopilot as it provides more precise guidance.
  - is required to provide the necessary level of guidance and precision during the
    turn.
  - allows the pilot to cross-check the DME arc guidance along the RF procedure.

  text: When flying an RF leg without autopilot, the flight director must be used
    for guidance. Why?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - The flight director will give a visual and audible alert if the actual navigation
    performance exceeds the RNP during the RF leg.
  - The flight director displays guidance based on the information received from ground-based
    transmitters.
  - The RNP system uploads the RF procedure to the FAC, which then provides guidance
    via the flight director.
  - The RF leg is based on fixed radius turn with guidance calculated by the aircraft’s
    RNAV system.

    that is often used to check against the Required Navigation Performance (RNP)
    value of a procedure or airspace. Which of these best describes the EPE?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - A measure of the accuracy of the flight management system for navigation, and
    is demonstrated during initial certification of the aircraft.
  - An average of the navigation errors computed by two or more FMSS when compared
    against each other and subsequently applied as a correction to improve position
    accuracy.
  - A measure of the reasonableness and accuracy of the given flight management position
    by applying a specific set of rules to the available navigation inputs.
  - A sum of all the navigational errors accumulated over time that may be used as
    a measure of the performance of the navigation system after a flight.
