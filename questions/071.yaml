    should be made?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - The magnetic compass may be unreliable or unusable; basic inertial navigation
    requires NO special procedures.
  - The Earth's vertical field strength is reduced and the ability of the compass
    to accurately sense Magnetic North is reduced.
  - Their DR position should be cross-checked with a bearing from a VOR, which should
    then be converted to true using the magnetic variation at the aircraft.
  - To check their position only NDBs should be used to obtain bearings and these
    should then be converted to true bearings using the magnetic variation at the
    station.

  options:
  - No, because the maximum allowable extension of the daily FDP is 30 minutes, which
    will not be enough to perform this diversion.
  - No, the maximum daily FDP may not be exceeded, so the aeroplane must continue

    from their company Operations Department requesting them to get airborne without
    delay. What should the pilot-in-command consider?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - In order to expedite the taxi and take-off the Commander could ask that only the
    main wings are de-iced.
  - The prevailing weather conditions are such that the aircraft must be de-iced and
    anti-iced before take-off, even if this results in a delay.
  - The Commander should check the cost and time it takes to de-ice and anti-ice to
    the aircraft and then decide if decontamination is enough to warrant de-icing/anti-icing.
  - The Commander may decide NOT to de-ice/anti-ice the aircraft in order to get airborne
    within the shortest amount of time.

  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - It can occur in places that would normally remain free of icing, such as in wheel
    wells during taxiing.
  - It collects more on the leading edges of the lift-producing surfaces.
  - De-icing fluid tends to remain on critical flight surfaces when the aircraft is
    on the ground and may become a hazard.
  - Any rain coming down has more of a chance to turn into drizzle and therefore be
    more difficult to remove.

    at Geneva, Switzerland (LSGG), and freezing rain starts to fall. In this scenario,
    what effect might have on the planned take-off?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - Ice may have formed on the pitot tubes, therefore the take-off speeds must be
    increased, and the rotation performed at a rate slightly below the normal.
  - Ice may have formed on the pitot tubes, giving false airspeed indications; de-icing
    and anti-icing will therefore be required.
  - There is a high probability that the pitot tubes and static vents may have become
    blocked, but this will NOT affect the take-off speed indications, since the aircraft
    has already begun to taxi; the take-off may be performed.
  - There will be NO possible effects on any of the cockpit indications, although
    the aircraft external surfaces should be checked for any ice deposits and the
    “clean aircraft” requirements satisfied before attempting to take-off.

  - During ground operations with slush/snow present, the aircraft's flaps/slats should
    remain retracted/closed, preventing deposition of slush or snow and avoiding the
    need to de-ice the aircraft.
  - On the aircraft horizontal surfaces an even layer of dry powder is present. The
    powder snow can be brushed off. When there is no precipitation, the Pilot in Command

    The aeroplanes with steel brakes should be taxied at a:'
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - Speed where the use of the brakes is kept to an absolute minimum in order to prevent
    brake fade; a similar procedure should be used for the aeroplanes with carbon
    brakes to prevent the brakes from overheating and oxidising.
  - Lower speed using frequent, short brake applications, whereas the aeroplanes with
    carbon brakes should be left to accelerate to a higher taxi speed before slowing
    right down to limit the number of brake applications.
  - Constant speed with the application of prolonged braking to gently allow the brakes
    to warm up to their optimum operating temperature; the aeroplanes with carbon
    brakes should have their taxi speed controlled by frequent, short brake applications.
  - Lower speed by keeping the brakes gently applied to minimise the number of applications;
    the aeroplane with carbon brakes should be allowed to accelerate to a higher speed

  options:
  - Descend below the glideslope and touch down as close to the landing threshold
    as possible.
  - Use reverse thrust when the speed is high and change to wheel braking when the
    speed reduces.
  - Avoid floating and apply more wheel braking earlier as their effect is better
    early in the landing roll.
