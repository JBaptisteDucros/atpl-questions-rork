    inboard ailerons are used, this is done to...
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - ensure that the wing does NOT twist through aero elastic effects which would modify
    the local angle of attack and generate roll reversal.
  - reduce the rolling moments which might generate excessive bending forces at their
    wing root if the outboard ailerons were to be used.
  - increase flight control redundancy in the aeroplane’s roll control should the
    outboard aileron system fail.
  - reduce the effects of adverse yaw which are greater when using outboard ailerons.

  text: What is the fundamental difference between a trim tab and a servo tab?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - The main purpose of a trim tab is to reduce stick force to zero in steady flight,
    a servo tab only reduces stick force.
  - A trim tab is automatically adjusted when its particular control surface moves,
    whereas a servo tab is moved independently of its particular control surface.
  - The functioning of a trim tab is based on aerodynamic balancing, whereas a servo
    tab is usually adjusted via a screwjack.
  - A servo tab affects the stick force stability, whereas a trim tab does not.

  options:
  - A trimmed aeroplane with an aft CG requires the stabiliser leading edge to be
    lower than in the case of a forward CG in the same condition.
  - Because take-off speeds do not vary with CG position, the need for stabiliser
    adjustment is dependent on flap position only.
  - A trimmed aeroplane with an aft CG requires the stabiliser leading edge to be
    higher than in the case of a forward CG in the same condition.

  text: Using conventional flight controls, you are manually piloting a jet transport
    aircraft as you decelerate from M0.76 to M0.73\. A supercritical wing design is
    used on the aircraft. To maintain altitude as the plane decelerates, you must
    continuously apply a small nose-down trim. As you decrease your speed through
    M 0.73, you find that there is a need for progressive nose-up trim. This could
    have several causes, including...
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - the slight pitch down moment due to shock waves reduces and the airplane returns
    to normal trim behavior below M**CRIT**
  - all the speed reduces below M**CRIT**, the shock waves increase in strength and
    create a nose-down pitching moment
  - shock waves forming at the rear of aerofoil creating increased lift at the back
    of the profile and therefore a nose down pitch moment
  - that the shock waves are increasing in strength, creating an increased nose down
    pitching moment, which requires a greater nose-up trim

    the Mach number at the time of the request. How can this be a solution to the
    request made by ATC?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - In order to maintain a constant Mach number, the aeroplane must pitch up slightly,
    resulting in the CAS reducing and an increased average rate of climb.
  - In order to maintain a constant Mach number, the aeroplane must reduce AoA, resulting
    in lower induced drag, giving an increased angle and rate of climb.
  - The aeroplane must increase the AoA to maintain lift as both the CAS and TAS are
    gradually reducing, resulting in an increased average rate of climb.
  - The aeroplane must pitch up to maintain a constant CAS and Mach number, and since
    the TAS reduces, the angle and rate of climb will both increase.

    you must continuously apply a small nose-down trim. As you increase your speed
    through M 0.74, you'll see that the airplane gradually needs less nose-down trim
    to maintain altitude. This could have several causes, including...
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - that the aeroplane is designed to be statically unstable in transonic flight to
    help accelerate through the increased drag from shock waves.
  - that the aeroplane is entering a state of overspeed and the shock waves have resulted
    in a shock stall, making the aeroplane dive.
  - reaching the maximum of nose-down trim that is available, making the horizontal
    -stabiliser stall, which results in the nose dropping.
  - that shock waves form, resulting in greater rear loading of the aerofoil, and
    creating a slightly increasing nose-down pitching moment.

  text: A modern jet transport aeroplane is cruising at 35000 ft in an area of mountain
    waves. The cruising speed is at M 0.79 with MMO at M 0.81 when the aeroplane suddenly
    experiences a positive wind shear. The autothrust is slow at reacting and the
    aeroplane reaches a speed of M 0.82 before starting to decelerate again. Apart
    from an overspeed warning, are there any other indications of the overspeed that
    may be apparent to the pilots?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - strong shock waves will be forming, creating separation of the boundary layer,
    causing a significant buffet as the aeroplane enters a high-speed shock stall.
  - with their feet resting on the floor, a slight vibration is felt through the fuselage
    structure, otherwise the aeroplane observes normal behaviour.
  - the aeroplane is buffeting and a significant pitch-down moment suddenly develops,
    requiring an immediate corrective action to avoid entering a dive.
  - unusually high levels of ambient wind noise followed by severe buffeting requiring
    a pitch-up input to ensure a rapid deceleration to a speed below MMO.

  text: Modern jet aeroplanes usually fly at speeds faster than MCRIT, since the increase
    in speed is more significant than the increase in drag. How is this achieved?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - By using an advanced wing technology with a greater curvature underneath to balance
    the acceleration over the top and therefore reduce the severity of the shock waves.
  - The aeroplanes are flown at lower altitudes where the TAS is higher for a given
    Mach number and therefore experience a delay in the onset of shock waves and wave
    drag.
  - By using a supercritical aerofoil to reduce the severity of shock waves and the
    amount of wave drag at a given Mach number, when compared to a conventional aerofoil.
  - The aeroplanes are capable of flying at a higher altitude where the air is less
    dense and therefore the effects of the shock waves are less severe and create
    less wave drag.

  - Flying faster than MCRIT reduces the amount of wave drag as the shock waves are
    weaker than when flying below MCRIT.
  - The aeroplane will have stronger, opposing shock waves that will cancel each other

  - feel significant buffeting from the shock waves, which from at speeds above MMO,
    further enhanced by the increased load factor.
  - experience momentary loss of control due to incipient shock stall until the aeroplane
    recovers and speed reduces below MMO.
  - experience a slight “Mach tuck” effect as shock waves increase in strength, leading
    to further speed increase and loss of speed control.
  - feel a slight vibration as a result of the increased positive load factor creating
    some buffet, due to shock waves during the overspeed.

    and after consulting the Minimum Equipment List (MEL), you see that flight without
    the yaw damper is restricted to not above FL170\. Why does this restriction exist?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - The yaw damper is required to balance any manually flown turns above FL170.
  - Aerodynamic damping decreases with altitude, so the aircraft could experience
    a series of unwanted rolling and yawing motions.
  - This exists as the yaw damper is a requirement for RVSM airspace which exists
    above FL170.
  - The aircraft may get control reversal at the high speeds encountered above FL170,
    without the yaw damper operative.

    the pilot deflects the ailerons only, holding a constant deflection. Eventually,
    the aircraft enters a spiral dive. After recovering, the pilot then inputs a constant
    rudder deflection only. This also causes a spiral dive. Which of the following
    statements is correct regarding aircraft stability?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - The ailerons are the main contributors to lateral stability and the rudder is
    the main contributor to directional stability.
  - The ailerons are secondary contributors to directional stability and the rudder
    is a secondary contributor to lateral stability.
  - Lateral and directional stabilities interact through sideslip, which is created
    when using either aileron or rudder alone.
  - Since the aeroplane enters an un-coordinated spiral dive, it is a result of both
    the lateral and directional stabilities being too weak.

  - The pitch rates commanded by the FBW system are lower at higher altitudes compared

  - The actual longitudinal stability is lower than calculated by the FBW system,
    and the system may allow for control surface deflections that result in instability.
  - The aircraft consumes more fuel than expected during the cruise phase of the flight,

    to adjust the thrust setting. This is due to...
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - gravity acts partially along the flight path when the aeroplane is descending
    and extending the landing gear increases drag sufficiently to prevent acceleration.
  - the thrust vector from the engine does NOT coincide with the flight path of the
    aeroplane in a descent and therefore the effective thrust force is reduced.
  - the increase in parasite drag due to landing gear extension is offset by the reduction
    in induced drag due to the pilot pitching down when commencing the final descent.
  - thrust acts along the flight path in a more efficient manner during a descent
    when compared to a climb and therefore offsets the drag increase generated by
    landing gear extension.

  options:
  - The auto-throttle system will prevent you from exceeding limitations.
  - If the autopilot is engaged, it will detect the malfunction and fly the actual
    airspeed, no matter the pitot blockages.
  - The air data computers should notice this fault and apply a suitable correction
    to get the correct IAS indication.
  - If the pilots do not recognise the unreliable airspeed condition, reducing thrust
    to control the IAS may cause the aircraft to stall.

  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - It will increase, because the pilot will have to reduce pitch attitude to maintain
    vertical speed, which will tend to increase as TAS increases with altitude.
  - It will decrease, because the pilot will have to increase pitch attitude to maintain
    vertical speed as Excess Thrust decreases with altitude.
  - It will increase, because the rearward component of Lift decreases with altitude,
    and as the thrust setting remains constant, the aeroplane will accelerate.
  - It wil decrease, because Drag increases with altitude, and as the trust settings
    remains constant, the aeroplane will decelerate.

  - To ensure that the wing tip stalls after the wing root to increase the stability
    in roll and reduce the likelihood of a wing-drop.
  - This increases the lift towards the wing tip, thereby ensuring a more even distribution
    of lift along the spanwise direction, Increasing efficiency.
  - To reduce the effect of wing-tip vortices and therefore ensure a more even distribution
    of lift along the chordwise direction.
  - This reduces the drag produced by the wing as the entire wing can operate at its

  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - The difference in winglet size does not affect the impact of ground effect.
  - Aircraft A is MORE affected by the change of induced drag compared to Aircraft
    B as bigger winglets INCREASE wingtip vortices.
  - Neither aircraft will experience ground effect as the presence of any winglets
    stop it completely.
  - Aircraft A is LESS affected by the change of induced drag compared to Aircraft

  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - By fitting winglets to the wing tip, the strength of the wing tip vortices is
    reduced which in turn reduces induced drag.
  - Vortex generators on the wing partially block the spanwise flow over the wing
    leading to a reduction in induced drag.
  - Slat extension, at a constant angle of attack and normal extension speeds, will
    increase the lift coefficient, which will also increase the induced drag coefficient.
  - Sweepback reduces drag since, compared with a straight wing of equal area, the
    span increases.

  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - reduce the stalling angle of attack at the wing tips to ensure the wing tips stall
    first so there is a more gradual loss of lift when stalling.
  - delay the stall at the wing tip to reduce the likelihood of the aeroplane experiencing
    significant rolling moments when stalled.
  - evenly spread the lift across the wing planform and increase its efficiency, resulting
    in minimum drag at the optimum angle of attack.
  - ensure that the entire wing stall occurs when the aeroplane is at a specific pitch
    angle, and to create an aeroplane with predictable stall characteristics.

    - **Static pressure decreases at the throat**


    # Long Explanation


    The Bernoulli''s principle states that in a fluid flow, an increase in velocity

    results in a decrease in pressure, and vice versa. This principle is commonly

    used to explain the behavior of fluids in motion, such as in the case of an

    airplane wing or a Venturi tube.

    The formula for total pressure in a fluid flow is the sum of dynamic pressure

    and static pressure. Dynamic pressure is the pressure due to the motion of the

    fluid, while static pressure is the pressure of the fluid when it is at rest.

    The total pressure is important to consider in fluid flow calculations, as it

    is a measure of the energy contained in the fluid.


    When a fluid flows through a Venturi tube, the constriction in the tube causes

    the velocity of the fluid to increase, according to the Bernoulli''s principle.

    This increase in velocity results in a decrease in static pressure in the

    throat of the tube. However, the total pressure of the fluid remains constant

    throughout the tube. Therefore, as the velocity increases, the static

    pressure decreases to maintain the constant total pressure. This phenomenon

    is used in many applications, such as in carburetors for gasoline engines

    or in fluid metering devices.'

  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - The rotation speed is too fast, significantly increasing drag and preventing the
    aircraft to lift off.
  - Ice can distort the flow of air over the wing, increasing the angle of attack
    for maximum lift and significantly increasing drag.
  - The rotation rate is too fast, increasing the critical angle of attack and preventing
    the aircraft to lift off.
  - The angle of attack during rotation exceeds the lower, icing-induced critical

  text: A light aircraft with mechanical flight controls occasionally experiences
    uncomfortable pitch oscillations after encountering normal turbulence. The pilot
    does not note any such oscillations when cruising in smooth air at normal cruising
    speed, but does notice some excessive slack or play in the elevator linkages after
    the flight. What potential hazards could this situation cause if not addressed
    by maintenance?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - The flutter may gradually worsen, and the elevator may vibrate so vigorously that
    it comes off the hinges and separates from the aeroplane in flight.
  - A poorly balanced control surface is creating excessive restoring forces and this
    short-period motion may cause excessive stress on the airframe.
  - This phugoid-type oscillation is likely to increase in magnitude and the aeroplane
    may enter a stall or encounter an overspeed situation if the oscillation worsens.
  - Compared to a phugoid, the short period motion leads to a change in pitch and
    speed, which, if NOT corrected, may lead to a stall or overspeed situation.

  options:
  - To counter icing conditions in a light aeroplane without de-icing, the pilot should
    reduce propeller RPM as far as possible.
  - Considering the whole aeroplane, the most critical effect of icing conditions
    is through ice formation on the propeller blades.
  - The presence of ice on propeller blades causes propeller efficiency to be reduced
    by up to 20%.
  - On a propeller blade, ice tends to form first towards the tip, due to the sharp
