  text: You are on an IFR flight in IMC. You have been cleared to descend from FL370
    to FL60 at the initial approach fix (IAF) for an ILS approach to runway 08 at
    the destination. ATC requested that you report passing FL180\. You receive no
    acknowledgement from ATC when passing FL180 and suspect a communication failure.
    What action should you pilot take?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - Proceed to fly the current flight plan and land within 20 minutes after the estimated
    time of arrival.
  - Continue the descent to FL60, squawk 7600 and land as soon as possible.
  - Maintain FL180 and proceed to fly the current flight plan route to the appropriate
    designated navigation aid to fix serving the destination aerodrome, before commencing
    descent.
  - Proceed to the IAF, descending to FL60, and hold over the IAF to arrive at, or
    as close as possible to, the estimated time of arrival resulting from the current
    flight plan.

    aerodrome; however, a report has to be made to the aerodrome of departure.
  - ICAO communication failure procedures take priority over any local regulations.
  - Both aeroplanes need to sqawk 7700 and make blind transmissions on 121.5 MHz.
  - Aeroplane A has to watch out for visual signals.

    flight, flying at FL140\. Your aircraft is equipped with all the necessary communication
    and navigation equipment. After 30 minutes of flight at cruising altitude, you
    notice the unserviceability of the air-ground data link. Weather conditions at
    the moment are moderate to severe icing. What is correct regarding the meteorological
    observation?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - You should attempt to re-start the data link system so that routine meteorological
    observations can be sent. If this remains unserviceable, a special transponder
    code should be selected.
  - The routine meteorological observations that are normally transmitted every 15
    minutes should now be sent via voice communications.
  - Because the data link is unserviceable, you are exempted from transmitting both
    routine and special meteorological observations.
  - Because the data link is unserviceable, a special meteorological observation should

    started the take off run while the other was taxiing onto the runway (taxiway
    was occupied). The aircraft taking off reported, “we are now at take-off”, and
    the tower replied “OK…, stand by for take-off. I will call you”. Simultaneously,
    the other aircraft taxiing onto the runway reported, “ah…hu..we are still taxiing
    down the runway”. What is the reason these last two transmissions might NOT have
    reached the take-off aircraft?
  type: multiple_choice
  options:
  - A technical reason is NOT to be suspected. Most likely, the crew was absorbed
    by the takeoff and probably failed to notice the calls.
  - If neither of the two messages was received, there must have been a failure of
    the receiver of the aircraft taking off. There is NO other possible explanation.
  - The message of the Tower must have been received. The transmissions of ground
    stations have a general priority to supersede other simultaneous transmissions.
  - As simultaneous transmissions on one frequency are NOT possible, they can block
    each other out. NOTHING or just interference noises might have been heard instead.
